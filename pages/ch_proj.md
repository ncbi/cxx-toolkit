Starting New Projects
---------------------

The following assumes that you have all of the necessary Toolkit components. If you need to obtain part or the Toolkit's entire source tree, consult the [FTP instructions](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.ftp_download) or [SVN checkout procedures](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.code_retrieval). Please visit the [Getting Started](ch_start.html) page for a broad overview of the NCBI C++ Toolkit and its use.

### New Projects: Location and File Structure

Before creating the new project, you must decide if you need to work within a C++ source tree (or subtree) or merely need to link with the Toolkit libraries and work in a separate directory. The later case is simpler and allows you to work independently in a private directory, but it is not an option if the Toolkit source, headers, or `makefiles` are to be directly used or altered during the new project's development.

-   [Work in the Full Toolkit Source Tree](#ch_proj.inside_tree)

-   [Work in a Toolkit Subtree](#ch_proj.work_sub_tree)

-   [Work in a Separate Directory](#ch_proj.outside_tree)

Regardless of where you build your new project, it must adopt and maintain a particular structure. Specifically, each project's [source tree](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src) relative to `$NCBI/c++` should contain:

-   `include/*.hpp` -- project's public headers

-   `src/*.{cpp, hpp}` -- project's source files and private headers

-   `src/Makefile.in` -- a [meta-makefile](#ch_proj.meta_makefiles) template to specify which local projects (described in `Makefile.*.in`) and sub-projects (located in the project subdirectories) must be built

-   `src/Makefile.<project_name>.{lib, app}[.in]` -- one or more `customized makefiles` to build a library or an application

-   `src/Makefile.*[.in]` -- "free style" makefiles (if any)

-   sub-project directories (if any)

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [new\_project: Starting a New Project outside the C++ Toolkit Tree](#ch_proj.new_project_Starting)

-   [Creating a New Project Inside the C++ Toolkit Tree](#ch_proj.Creating_a_New_Proje)

<a name="ch_proj.new_project_Starting"></a>

#### **new\_project**: Starting a New Project outside the C++ Toolkit Tree

Script usage:

    new_project <name> <type>[/<subtype>] [builddir]

***NOTE***: in NCBI, you can (and should) invoke common scripts simply by name - i.e. without path or extension. The proper script located in the pre-built NCBI C++ toolkit directory will be invoked.

This script will create a startup makefile for a new project which uses the NCBI C++ Toolkit (and possibly the C Toolkit as well). Replace `<type>` with `lib` for libraries or `app` for applications.

Sample code will be included in the project directory for new applications. Different samples are available for `type=app[/basic]` (a command-line argument demo application based on the [corelib](ch_core.html) library), `type=app/cgi` (for a [CGI or Fast-CGI](ch_cgi.html) application), `type=app/objmgr` (for an application using the `Object Manager`), `type=app/objects` (for an application using ASN.1 objects), and many others.

You will need to slightly edit the resultant makefile to:

-   specify the name of your library (or application)

-   specify the list of source files going to it

-   modify some preprocessor, compiler, etc. flags, if needed

-   modify the set of additional libraries to link to it (if it's an application), if needed

For example:

    new_project foo app/basic

creates a model makefile `Makefile.foo_app` to build an application using tools and flags hard-coded in `$NCBI/c++/Debug/build/Makefile.mk`, and headers from `$NCBI/c++/include/`. The file `/tmp/foo/foo.cpp` is also created; you can either replace this with your own `foo.cpp` or modify its sample code as required.

Now, after specifying the application name, list of source files, etc., you can just go to the created working directory `foo/` and build your application using:

    make -f Makefile.foo_app

You can easily change the active version of NCBI C++ Toolkit by manually setting variable **`$(builddir)`** in the file `Makefile.foo_app` to the desired Toolkit path, e.g.,

    builddir = $(NCBI)/c++.current/GCC-Release/build

***Note:*** On Unix, the default build is the production build - because `$(NCBI)/c++` is a symbolic link to `$(NCBI)/c++.production`. On Windows, the default build is the current build. Windows builds have the form: `\\snowman\win-coremake\Lib\Ncbi\CXX_Toolkit\msvc10\cxx.stable`

In many cases, you work on your own project which **is a part** of the NCBI C++ tree, and you do not want to check out, update and rebuild the whole NCBI C++ tree. Instead, you just want to use headers and libraries of the pre-built NCBI C++ Toolkit to build your project. In these cases, use the [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh) script instead of `new_project`.

***Note for users inside NCBI:*** To be able to view debug information in the Toolkit libraries for Windows builds, you will need to have the `S:` drive mapped to `\\snowman\win-coremake\Lib`. By default, `new_project` will make this mapping for you if it's not already done.

#### Creating a New Project Inside the C++ Toolkit Tree

To create your new project (e.g., "bar\_proj") directories in the NCBI C++ Toolkit source tree (assuming that the entire NCBI C++ Toolkit has been [checked out](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.chkout_complete_tree) to directory `foo/c++/`):

    cd foo/c++/include && mkdir bar_proj && svn add bar_proj
    cd foo/c++/src     && mkdir bar_proj && svn add bar_proj

From there, you can now [add](#ch_proj.new_modules) and edit your project C++ files.

NOTE: remember to add this new project directory to the **`$(SUB_PROJ)`** list of the upper level [meta-makefile](ch_build.html#ch_build.makefiles_meta) configurable template (e.g., for this particular case, to `foo/c++/src/Makefile.in`).

<a name="ch_proj.cvs_tree_struct"></a>

### Projects and the Toolkit's SVN Tree Structure

(For the overall NCBI C++ SVN tree structure see [SVN details](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.source_tree).)

Even if you work outside of the C++ tree, it is necessary to understand how the Toolkit uses `makefiles`, `meta-makefiles`, and `makefile templates`, and the SVN tree structure.

The standard SVN location for NCBI C++/STL projects is `$SVNROOT/internal/c++/`. Public header files (`*.hpp, *.inl`) of all projects are located below the `$SVNROOT/internal/c++/include/` directory. `$SVNROOT/internal/c++/src/` directory has just the same hierarchy of subdirectories as `.../include/`, and its very top level contains:

-   Templates of generic makefiles (`Makefile.*.in`):

    -   `Makefile.in` -- makefile to perform a recursive build in all project subdirectories

    -   `Makefile.meta.in` -- included by all makefiles that provide both local and recursive builds

    -   `Makefile.lib.in` -- included by all makefiles that perform a "standard" library build, when building only static libraries.

    -   `Makefile.dll.in` -- included by all makefiles that perform a "standard" library build, when building only shared libraries.

    -   `Makefile.both.in` -- included by all makefiles that perform a "standard" library build, when building both static and shared libraries.

    -   `Makefile.lib.tmpl.in` -- serves as a template for the project `customized makefiles` (`Makefile.*.lib[.in]`) that perform a "standard" library build

    -   `Makefile.app.in` -- included by all makefiles that perform a "standard" application build

    -   `Makefile.lib.tmpl.in` -- serves as a template for the project `customized makefiles` (`Makefile.*.app[.in]`) that perform a "standard" application build

    -   `Makefile.rules.in, Makefile.rules_with_autodep.in` -- instructions for building object files; included by most other makefiles

    -   `Makefile.mk.in` -- included by all makefiles; sets a lot of configuration variables

-   The contents of each project are detailed [above](#ch_proj.new_proj_struct). If your project is to become part of the Toolkit tree, you need to ensure that all `makefiles` and `Makefile*.in` templates are available so the master `makefiles` can properly configure and build it (see "[Meta-Makefiles](#ch_proj.meta_makefiles)" and "[Project Makefiles"](#ch_proj.proj_makefiles) below). You will also need to [prepare SVN directories](#ch_proj.src_include_dirs) to hold the new source and header files.

<a name="ch_proj.src_include_dirs"></a>

### Creating source and include SVN dirs for a new C++ project

To create your new project (e.g., "bar\_proj") directories in the NCBI C++ SVN tree to directory `foo/c++/`):

    cd foo/c++/include && mkdir bar_proj && SVN add -m "Project Bar" bar_proj
    cd foo/c++/src     && mkdir bar_proj && SVN add -m "Project Bar" bar_proj

Now you can [add](#ch_proj.new_modules) and edit your project C++ files in there.

***NOTE:*** remember to add this new project directory to the **`$(SUB_PROJ)`** list of the upper level [meta-makefile](#ch_proj.meta_makefiles) configurable template (e.g., for this particular case, to `foo/c++/src/Makefile.in`).

<a name="ch_proj.new_modules"></a>

### Starting New Modules

Projects in the NCBI C++ Toolkit consist of “modules”, which are most often a pair of source `(*.cpp`) and header (`*.hpp`) files. To help create new modules, template source and header files may be used, or you may modify the sample code generated by the script [new\_project](#ch_proj.new_project_Starting). The template source and header files are `.../doc/public/framewrk.cpp` and `.../doc/public/framewrk.hpp`. The template files contain a standard startup framework so that you can just cut-and-paste them to start a new module (just don't forget to replace the "framewrk" stubs by your new module name).

-   Header file (\*.hpp) -- API for the external users. Ideally, this file contains only (well-commented) declarations and inline function implementations for the public interface. No less, and no more.

-   Source file (\*.cpp) -- Definitions of non-inline functions and internally used things that should not be included by other modules.

On occasion, a second private header file is required for good encapsulation. Such second headers should be placed in the same directory as the module source file.

Each and every source file **must** include the NCBI disclaimer and (preferably) Subversion keywords (e.g. $Id$). Then, the header file must be protected from double-inclusion, and it must define any inlined functions.

<a name="ch_proj.meta_makefiles"></a>

### Meta-makefiles (to provide multiple and/or recursive builds)

All projects from the NCBI C++ hierarchy are tied together by a set of `meta-makefiles` which are present in all project source directories and provide a uniform and easy way to perform both local and recursive builds. See more detail on the [Working with Makefiles](ch_build.html) page. A typical `meta-makefile` template (e.g. `Makefile.in` in your `foo/c++/src/bar_proj/` dir) looks like that:

    # Makefile.bar_u1, Makefile.bar_u2 ...
    USR_PROJ = bar_u1 bar_u2 ...
    # Makefile.bar_l1.lib, Makefile.bar_l2.lib ...
    LIB_PROJ = bar_l1 bar_l2 ...
    # Makefile.bar_a1.app, Makefile.bar_a2.app ...
    APP_PROJ = bar_a1 bar_l2 ...
    SUB_PROJ = app sub_proj1 sub_proj2
    srcdir = @srcdir@
    include @builddir@/Makefile.meta

This template separately specifies instructions for user, library and application projects, along with a set of three sub-projects that can be made. The mandatory final two lines `"srcdir = @srcdir@ ; include @builddir@/Makefile.meta"` define the [standard build targets](ch_build.html#ch_build.std_build_targets).

<a name="ch_proj.proj_makefiles"></a>

### Project makefiles

Just like the configurable template `Makefile.meta.in` is used to ease and standardize the writing of [meta-makefiles](#ch_proj.meta_makefiles), so there are templates to help in the creation of "regular" project makefiles to build a library or an application. These auxiliary template makefiles are described on the "[Working with Makefiles](ch_build.html#ch_build.makefiles_hierarch)" page and listed [above](#ch_proj.cvs_tree_struct). The **configure**'d versions of these templates get put at the very top of a `build tree`.

In addition to the `meta-makefile` that must be defined for each project, a customized makefile `Makefile.<project_name>.[app|lib]` must also be provided. The following three sections give examples of `customized makefiles` for a [library](#ch_proj.make_proj_lib) and an [application](#ch_proj.make_proj_app), along with a case where a [user-defined](#ch_proj.usr_def_makefile) `makefile` is required.

You have great latitude in specifying optional packages, features and projects in `makefiles`. The macro **`REQUIRES`** in the examples is one way to allows you access them. See the "`Working with Makefiles`" page for a [complete list](ch_build.html#ch_build.packages_opt); the configuration page gives the corresponding [configure options](ch_config.html#ch_config.ch_configprohibit_sy).

The following examples are discussed in this section:

-   [Example 1: Customized makefile to build a library](#ch_proj.make_proj_lib)

-   [Example 2: Customized makefile to build an application](#ch_proj.make_proj_app)

-   [Example 3: User-defined makefile to build... whatever](#ch_proj.usr_def_makefile)

<a name="ch_proj.make_proj_lib"></a>

#### Example 1: Customized makefile to build a library

Here is an example of a `customized makefile` to build either a library `libxmylib.a` or a shared library `libxmylib.so` from two source files `xmy_src1.cpp` and `xmy_src2.c`, and one pre-compiled object file `some_obj1.o`. To make the example even more realistic, we assume that the said source files include headers from the NCBI C Toolkit.

    LIB      = xmylib
    SRC      = xmy_src1 xmy_src2
    OBJ      = some_obj1
    REQUIRES = xrequirement

    # For a static library, this is optional (but can be used to override --with-dll):
    LIB_OR_DLL = lib
    # To encourage building a shared library (for capable platforms), this is required:
    LIB_OR_DLL = dll
    # You can also encourage building both a static and a shared version of the library:
    LIB_OR_DLL = both

    # To resolve external references for shared libraries:
    #   if using --with-dll or --with-gbench
    DLL_DLIB = xncbi
    #   else
    DLL_LIB = xncbi

    # To require that a library must have all externals resolved:
    DLL_UNDEF_FLAGS = $(FORBID_UNDEF)

    # For third-party references:
    LIBS = $(NETWORK_LIBS)

    CFLAGS   = $(ORIG_CFLAGS)   -abc -DFOOBAR_NOT_CPLUSPLUS
    CXXFLAGS = $(FAST_CXXFLAGS) -xyz
    CPPFLAGS = $(ORIG_CPPFLAGS) -UFOO -DP1_PROJECT -I$(NCBI_C_INCLUDE)

Here are the steps the build process follows:

-   Skip building this library if `xrequirement` ([an optional package or project](ch_build.html#ch_build.packages_opt)) is disabled or unavailable.

-   Compile `xmy_src1.cpp` using the C++ compiler **`$(CXX)`** with the flags `$(FAST_CXXFLAGS) -xyz $(CPPFLAGS)`, which are the C++ flags for faster code, some additional flags specified by the user, and the original preprocessor flags.

-   Compile `xmy_src2.c` using the C compiler **`$(CC)`** with the flags `$(ORIG_CFLAGS) -abc -DFOOBAR_NOT_CPLUSPLUS $(CPPFLAGS)`, which are the original C flags, some additional flags specified by the user, and the original preprocessor flags.

-   If building a static library: Using **`$(AR)`** and **`$(RANLIB)`**, compose the library `libxmylib.a` from the resultant object files, plus the pre-compiled object file `some_obj1.o`.

-   If building a shared library: Using **`$(LINK_DLL)`**, compose the library `libxmylib.so` from the resultant object files, plus the pre-compiled object file `some_obj1.o`.

-   Copy `libxmylib.*` to the top-level `lib/` directory of the `build tree` (for the later use by other projects).

This `customized makefile` should be referred to as `xmylib` in the **`LIB_PROJ`** macro of the relevant [meta-makefile](#ch_proj.meta_makefiles). As usual, [Makefile.mk](ch_build.html#ch_build.build_make_macros) will be implicitly included.

For information about run-time linking with shared libraries, see [this section](ch_config.html#ch_config.ch_configconfightml_).

<a name="ch_proj.make_proj_app"></a>

#### Example 2: Customized makefile to build an application

Here is an example of a `customized makefile` to build the application **my\_exe** from three source files, `my_main.cpp`, `my_src1.cpp`, and `my_src2.c`. To make the example even more realistic, we assume that the said source files include headers from the NCBI SSS DB packages, and the target executable uses the NCBI C++ libraries [libxmylib.\*](#ch_proj.make_proj_lib) and `libxncbi.*`, plus NCBI SSS DB, SYBASE, and system network libraries. We assume further that the user would prefer to link statically against libxmylib if building the toolkit as both shared and static libraries (`configure --with-dll --with-static ...`), but is fine with a shared libxncbi.

    APP      = my_exe
    SRC      = my_main my_src1 my_src2
    OBJ      = some_obj
    LIB      = xmylib$(STATIC) xncbi
    REQUIRES = xrequirement
    CPPFLAGS = $(ORIG_CPPFLAGS) $(NCBI_SSSDB_INCLUDE)
    LIBS     = $(NCBI_SSSDB_LIBS) $(SYBASE_LIBS) $(NETWORK_LIBS) $(ORIG_LIBS)

-   Skip building this library if `xrequirement` ([an optional package or project](ch_build.html#ch_build.packages_opt)) is disabled or unavailable.

-   Compile `my_main.cpp` and `my_src1.cpp` using the C++ compiler **`$(CXX)`** with the flags **`$(CXXFLAGS)`** (see Note below).

-   Compile `my_src2.c` using the C compiler **`$(CC)`** with the flags **`$(CFLAGS)`** (see Note below).

-   Using **`$(CXX)`** as a linker, build an executable **my\_exe** from the object files `my_main.o, my_src1.o, my_src2.o`, the precompiled object file `some_obj.o`, NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries [libxmylib.a](#ch_proj.make_proj_lib) and `libxncbi.*`, and NCBI SSS DB, SYBASE, and system network libraries (see Note below).

-   Copy the application to the top-level `bin/` directory of the `build tree` (for later use by other projects).

***Note:*** Since we did not redefine **`CFLAGS`**, **`CXXFLAGS`**, or **`LDFLAGS`**, their default values **`ORIG_*FLAGS`** (obtained during the `build tree `[configuration](ch_config.html#ch_config.Configuration_and_In)) will be used.

This `customized makefile` should be referred to as **my\_exe** in the **`APP_PROJ`** macro of the relevant [meta-makefile](#ch_proj.meta_makefiles). Note also, that the [Makefile.mk](ch_build.html#ch_build.build_make_macros) will be implicitly included.

<a name="ch_proj.usr_def_makefile"></a>

#### Example 3: User-defined makefile to build... whatever

In some cases, we may need more functionality than the `customized makefiles` (designed to build libraries and applications) can provide.

So, if you have a "regular" non-customized `user makefile`, and you want to make from it, then you must enlist this `user makefile` in the **`USR_PROJ`** macro of the project's [meta-makefile](#ch_proj.meta_makefiles).

Now, during the project build (and before any `customized makefiles` are processed), your makefile will be called with one of the [standard make targets](ch_build.html#ch_build.build_make_proj_target) from the project's build directory. Additionally, the [builddir](ch_build.html#ch_build.T1) and [srcdir](ch_build.html#ch_build.T1) macros will be passed to your makefile (via the **make** command line).

In most cases, it is necessary to know your "working environment"; i.e., tools, flags and paths (those that you use in your `customized makefiles`). This can be easily done by including [Makefile.mk](ch_build.html#ch_build.build_make_macros) in your makefile.

Shown below is a real-life example of a `user makefile`:

-   build an auxiliary application using the customized makefile `Makefile.hc_gen_obj.app` (this part is a tricky one...)

-   use the resultant application `$(bindir)/hc_gen_obj` to generate the source and header files `humchrom_dat.[ch]` from the data file `humchrom.dat`

-   use the script **$(top\_srcdir)/scripts/if\_diff.sh** to replace the previous copies (if any) of `humchrom_dat.[ch]` with the newly generated versions if and only if the new versions are different (or there were no old versions).

And, of course, it provides build rules for all the [standard make targets](ch_build.html#ch_build.build_make_proj_target).

    File $(top_srcdir)/src/internal/humchrom/Makefile.hc_gen_obj:
    # Build a code generator for hard-coding the chrom data into
    # an obj file
    # Generate header and source "humchrom_dat.[ch]" from data
    # file "humchrom.dat"
    # Deploy the header to the compiler-specific include dir

### Obtaining the Very Latest Builds

Each new nightly build is available in the `$NCBI/c++.by-date/{date}` subdirectory. This is done regardless of whether the build succeeds or not.

There are defined symlinks into this directory tree. They include:

-   `$NCBI/c++` - Symbolic link to `$NCBI/c++.production`.

-   `$NCBI/c++.potluck` - The most recent nightly build. It contains whatever libraries and executables have managed to build, and it can miss some of the libraries and/or executables. Use it if you desperately need yesterday's bug fix and do not care of the libraries which are missing.

-   `$NCBI/c++.metastable` - The most recent nightly build for which the compilation (but not necessarily the test suite) succeeded in all configurations on the given platform. Please note that some projects, including the entire "`gui`" tree, are considered expendable due to their relative instability and therefore not guaranteed to be present.

-   `$NCBI/c++.current` - Symbolic link to `$NCBI/c++.metastable`.

-   `$NCBI/c++.stable` - The most recent nightly build for which the nightly build (INCLUDING the gui projects) succeeded AND the test suite passed all critical tests on the given platform. This would be the preferred build most of the time for the developers whose projects make use of the actively developed C++ Toolkit libraries. It is usually relatively recent (usually no more than 1 or 2 weeks behind), and at the same time quite stable.

-   `$NCBI/c++.frozen` - A "production candidate" build made out of the production codebase. There are usually two such builds made for each version of production codebase -- one is for the original production build, and another (usually made in about 2 months after the original production build) is the follow-up bugfix build.

-   `$NCBI/c++.production` - The most recent production snapshot. This is determined based on general stability of the Toolkit and it is usually derived off the codebase of one of the prior "`c++.stable`" builds. Its codebase is the same for all platforms and configurations. It is installed only on the major NCBI development platforms (Linux, MS-Windows, and MacOS). It is the safest bet for long-term development. It changes rarely, once in 1 to 3 months. Also, unlike all other builds mentioned here it is guaranteed to be accessible for at least a year (or more), and its DLLs are installed on all (including production) Linux hosts.

-   `$NCBI/c++.prod-head` - This build is for NCBI developers to quickly check their planned stable component commits using [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh). It is based on the repository path `toolkit/production/candidates/production.HEAD` – which is the HEAD SVN revision of the C++ Stable Components on which the latest c++.production build was based. It is available on 64-bit Linux.

-   `$NCBI/c++.trial` - This build is for NCBI developers to quickly check their planned stable component commits using [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh). It is based on the repository path `toolkit/production/candidates/trial` – which is usually a codebase for the upcoming production build. It is available on 64-bit Linux.

### Working in a separate directory

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Setting up Directory Location](#ch_proj.outside_dir_loc)

-   [The Project's Makefile](#ch_proj.outside_tree_makefile)

-   [Testing your setup](#ch_proj.outside_testing)

<a name="ch_proj.outside_dir_loc"></a>

#### Setting up Directory Location

There are two topics relevant to writing an application using the NCBI C++ Toolkit:

-   Where to place the source and header files for the project

-   How to create a makefile which can link to the correct C++ libraries

What you put in your makefile will depend on where you define your working directory. In this discussion, we assume you will be working **outside** the NCBI C++ tree, say in a directory called `newproj`. This is where you will write both your source and header files. The first step then, is to create the new working directory and use the [new\_project](#ch_proj.new_project_Starting) script to install a makefile there:

    mkdir newproj
    new_project newproj app $NCBI/c++/GCC-Debug/build
        Created a model makefile "/home/user/newproj/Makefile.newproj_app".

The syntax of the script command is:

    new_project <project_name> <app | lib> [builddir]

where: - `project_name` is the name of the directory you will be working in - `app (lib)` is used to indicate whether you will be building an application or a library - `builddir` (optional) specifies what version of the pre-built NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries to link to

Several build environments have been pre-configured and are available for developing on various platforms using different compilers, in either **debug** or **release** mode. These environments include custom-made configuration files, makefile templates, and links to the appropriate pre-built C++ Toolkit libraries. To see a list of the available environments for the platform you are working on, use: `ls -d $NCBI/c++/*/build`. For example, on `Solaris`, the build directories currently available are shown in [Table 1](#ch_proj.T1).

<a name="ch_proj.T1"></a>

Table 1. Build Directories

| Directory                                  | Compiler     | Version                     |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|
| `/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/Debug/build `      | Sun Workshop | Debug                       |
| `/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/Debug64/build `    | Sun Workshop | Debug (64 bit)              |
| `/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/DebugMT/build `    | Sun Workshop | Debug (Multi-thread safe)   |
| `/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/Release/build `    | Sun Workshop | Release                     |
| `/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/ReleaseMT/build `  | Sun Workshop | Release (Multi-thread safe) |
| `/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/GCC-Debug/build `  | GCC          | Debug                       |
| `/netopt/ncbi_tools/c++/GCC-Release/build` | GCC          | Release                     |

<div class="table-scroll"></div>

In the example above, we specified the GNU compiler debug environment: `$NCBI/c++/GCC-Debug/build`. For a list of currently supported compilers, see the [release notes](https://ncbiconfluence.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/display/CXX/Release+Notes#ReleaseNotes-release_notes.Platforms_OSs__compi). Running the **new\_project** script will generate a ready-to-use makefile in the directory you just created. For a more detailed description of this and other scripts to assist you in the set-up of your working environment, see [Starting a new C++ project](#ch_proj.start_new_proj).

<a name="ch_proj.outside_tree_makefile"></a>

#### The Project's Makefile

The file you just created with the above script will be called `Makefile.newproj_app`. In addition to other things, you will see definitions for: - **`$(builddir) `**- a path to the build directory specified in the last argument to the above script - **`$(srcdir) `**- the path to your current working directory (".") - **`$(APP) `**- the application name - **`$(OBJ) `**- the names of the object modules to build and link to the application - **`$(LIB)`** - specific libraries to link to in the NCBI C++ Toolkit - **`$(LIBS) `**- all other libraries to link to (outside the C++ Toolkit)

`$(builddir)/lib` specifies the library path (-L), which in this case points to the GNU debug versions of the NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries. $(LIB) lists the individual libraries in this path that you will be linking to. Minimally, this should include `xncbi` - the library which implements the foundational classes for the C++ tools. Additional library names (e.g. `xhtml, xcgi, `etc.) can be added here.

Since the shell script assumes you will be building a single executable with the same name as your working directory, the application is defined simply as **newproj**. Additional targets to build can be added in the area indicated towards the end of the file. The list of objects (OBJ) should include the names (without extensions) of all source files for the application (APP). Again, the script makes the simplest assumption, i.e. that there is a single source file named `newproj.cpp`. Additional source names can be added here.

<a name="ch_proj.outside_testing"></a>

#### Testing your setup

For a very simple application, this makefile is ready to be run. Try it out now, by creating the file `newproj.cpp`:

    // File name: newproj.cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    int main() {
    cout << "Hello again, world" << endl;
    }

and running:

    make -f Makefile.newproj_app

Of course, it wasn't necessary to set up the directories and makefiles to accomplish this much, as this example does not use any of the C++ classes or resources defined in the NCBI C++ Toolkit. But having accomplished this, you are now prepared to write an actual application, such as described in [Writing a simple application project](ch_core.html#ch_core.writing_simple_app)

Most real applications will at a minimum, require that you `#include `[ncbistd.hpp](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/corelib/ncbistd.hpp) in your header file. In addition to defining some basic NCBI C++ Toolkit objects and templates, this header file in turn includes other header files that define the C Toolkit data types, NCBI namespaces, debugging macros, and exception classes. A set of [template](#ch_proj.new_modules) files are also provided for your use in developing new applications.

<a name="ch_proj.work_sub_tree"></a>

### Working Independently In a C++ Subtree

An alternative to developing a new project from scratch is to work within a subtree of the main NCBI C++ source tree so as to utilize the header, source, and make files defined for that subtree. One way to do this would be to check out the entire source tree and then do all your work within the selected subtree(s) only. A better solution is to create a new working directory and check out only the relevant subtrees into that directory. This is somewhat complicated by the distributed organization of the C++ SVN tree: header files are (recursively) contained in an `include` subtree, while source files are (recursively) contained in a `src` subtree. Thus, multiple checkouts may be required to set things up properly, and the customized makefiles (`Makefile.*.app`) will need to be modified. The shell script [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh) will do all of this for you. The syntax is:

    import_project subtree_name [builddir]

where:

-   **`subtree_name`** is the path to a selected directory inside `[internal/]c++/src/`

-   **`builddir`** (optional) specifies what version of the pre-built NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries to link to.

As a result of executing this shell script, you will have a new directory created with the pathname `./[internal/]c++/` whose structure contains "slices" of the original SVN tree. Specifically, you will find:

    ./[internal/]c++/include/subtree_name
    ./[internal/]c++/src/subtree_name

The `src` and `include` directories will contain all of the requested subtree's source and header files along with any hierarchically defined subdirectories. In addition, the script will create new makefiles with the suffix *\*\_app*. These makefiles are generated from the original [customized makefiles](#ch_proj.make_proj_app) (`Makefile.*.app`) located in the original `src` subtrees. The customized makefiles were designed to work only in conjunction with the build directories in the larger NCBI C++ tree; the newly created makefiles can be used directly in your new working directories.

You can re-run **import\_project** to add multiple projects to your tree.

***Note:*** If you'd like to import both internal and public projects into a single tree, you'll need to use the `-topdir` option, which will locate the public project within the internal tree, for example:

    import_project internal/demo/misc/xmlwrapp
    import_project -topdir trunk/internal/c++ misc/xmlwrapp
    pushd trunk/internal/c++/src/misc/xmlwrapp
    make
    popd
    pushd trunk/internal/c++/src/internal/demo/misc/xmlwrapp
    make

In this case, your public projects will be located in the `internal` tree. You must build in each imported subtree, in order from most-dependent to least-dependent so that the imported libraries will be linked to rather than the pre-built libraries.

The NCBI C++ Toolkit project directories, along with the libraries they implement and the logical modules they entail, are summarized in the [Library Reference](part3.html).

Two project directories, `internal `and `objects`, may have some subdirectories for which the [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh) script does not work normally, if at all. The `internal `subdirectories are used for in-house development, and the author of a given project may customize the project for their own needs in a way that is incompatible with [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh). The `objects` subdirectories are used as the original repositories for ASN.1 specifications (which are available for use in your application as described in the section [Processing ASN.1 Data](ch_ser.html#ch_ser.asn.html)), and subsequently, for writing the object definitions and implementations created by the **datatool** program. Again, these projects can be altered in special ways and some may not be compatible with [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh). Generally, however, [import\_project](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.import_project_sh) should work well with most of these projects.

### Working within the C++ source tree

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Checkout the source tree and configure a build directory](#ch_proj.inside_checkout)

-   [The project's directories and makefiles](#ch_proj.inside_makefiles)

-   [Makefile.in meta files](#ch_proj.inside_make_meta)

-   [An example meta-makefile and its associated project makefiles](#ch_proj.inside_example)

-   [Executing make](#ch_proj.inside_make_exec)

-   [Custom project makefile: Makefile.myProj](#ch_proj.inside_cust_make)

-   [Library project makefile: Makefile.myProj.lib](#ch_proj.inside_lib_make)

-   [Application project makefile: Makefile.myProj.app](#ch_proj.inside_app_make)

-   [Defining and running tests](#ch_proj.inside_tests)

-   [The configure scripts](#ch_proj.inside_config)

Most users will find that working in a `checked-out` subtree or a private directory is preferable to working directly in the C++ source tree. There are two good reasons to avoid doing so:

-   Building your own versions of the extensive libraries can be very time-consuming.

-   There is no guarantee that the library utilities your private code links to have not become obsolete.

This section is provided for those developers who must work within the source tree. The [Library Reference](part3.html) provides more complete and technical discussion of the topics reviewed here, and many links to the relevant sections are provided. This page is provided as an overview of material presented in the Library Reference and on the [Working with Makefiles](ch_build.html) pages.

<a name="ch_proj.inside_checkout"></a>

#### Checkout ([\*](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.source_tree)) the source tree and configure a build directory

To checkout full Toolkit tree:

`svn co https://svn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repos/toolkit/trunk/internal/c++ c++`

or, if you don't need internal projects:

`svn co https://svn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repos/toolkit/trunk/c++ c++`

Once you have done so, you will need to run one of the **configure** scripts in the Toolkit's root directory. For example, to configure your environment to work with the **gcc** compiler (on any platform), just run: **./configure**.

Users working under Windows should consult the [MS Visual C++](ch_config.html#ch_config.MS_Windows) section in the chapter on [Configuring and Building the Toolkit](ch_config.html).

The [configure script](ch_config.html#ch_config.Configuration_and_In) is a multi-platform configuration shell script (generated from `configure.in` using **autoconf**). Here are some pointers to sections that will help you configure the build environment:

-   [Wrapper scripts](ch_config.html#ch_config.Special_Consideratio) supporting various platforms

-   [Optional configuration flags](ch_config.html#ch_config.Running_the_configur)

The **configure** script concludes with a message describing how to build the C++ Toolkit libraries. If your application will be working with ASN.1 data, use the `--with-objects` flag in running the **configure** script, so as to populate the `include/objects` and `src/objects` subdirectories and build the `objects` libraries. The `objects` directories and libraries can also be updated separately from the rest of the compilation, by executing **make** inside the `build/objects` directory. Prior to doing so however, you should always verify that your `build/bin` directory contains the latest version of **datatool**.

<a name="ch_proj.inside_makefiles"></a>

#### The project's directories and makefiles

To start a new project ("`myProj`"), you should begin by creating both a `src` and an `include` subtree for that project inside the C++ tree. In general, all header files that will be accessed by multiple source modules outside the project directory should be placed in the `include` directory. Header files that will be used solely inside the project's `src` directory should be placed in the `src` directory, along with the implementation files.

In addition to the C++ source files, the `src` subtrees contain `meta-makefiles` named `Makefile.in`, which are used by the **configure** script to generate the corresponding makefiles in the `build` subtrees. Figure 1 shows slices of the directory structure reflecting the correspondences between the `meta-makefiles` in the `src` subtrees and makefiles in the `build` subtrees. Figure 2 is a sketch of the entire C++ tree in which these directories are defined.

During the configuration process, each of the `meta-makefiles` in the top-level of the `src` tree is translated into a corresponding makefile in the top-level of the `build` tree. Then, for each project directory containing a `Makefile.in`, the **configure** script will: (1) create a corresponding subdirectory of the same name in the `build` tree if it does not already exist, and (2) generate a corresponding makefile in the project's `build` subdirectory. The contents of the project's `Makefile.in` in the `src` subdirectory determine what is written to the project's makefile in the `build` subdirectory. Project subdirectories that do not contain a `Makefile.in` file are ignored by the **configure** script.

Thus, you will also need to create a `meta-makefile` in the newly created `src/myProj` directory before configuring your `build` directory to include the new project. The **configure** script will then create the corresponding subtree in the `build` directory, along with a new makefile generated from the `Makefile.in` you created. See Makefile Hierarchy (Chapter 4, [Figure 1](ch_build.html#ch_build.F1)) and [Figure 1](#ch_proj.F1).

<a name="ch_proj.F1"></a>

Figure 1. Meta makefiles and the makefiles they generate

<a name="ch_proj.inside_make_meta"></a>

#### Makefile.in meta files

The meta-makefile `myProj/Makefile.in` should define at least one of the following macros:

-   **`USR_PROJ`** (optional) - a list of names for user-defined makefiles.<br/>This macro is provided for the usage of ordinary stand-alone makefiles which do not utilize the **make** commands contained in additional makefiles in the top-level `build` directory. Each `p_i` listed in `USR_PROJ = p_1 ... p_N` must have a corresponding [Makefile.p\_i](#ch_proj.inside_cust_make) in the project's source directory. When **make** is executed, the **make** directives contained in these files will be executed directly to build the targets as specified.

-   **`LIB_PROJ`** (optional) - a list of names for library makefiles.<br/>For each library `l_i` listed in `LIB_PROJ = l_1 ... l_N`, you must have created a corresponding project makefile named [Makefile.l\_i.lib](#ch_proj.inside_lib_make) in the project's source directory. When **make** is executed, these library project makefiles will be used along with `Makefile.lib` and `Makefile.lib.tmpl` (located in the top-level of the `build` tree) to build the specified libraries.

-   **`APP_PROJ`** (optional) - a list of names for application makefiles.<br/>Similarly, each application (`p1, p2, ..., pN`) listed under **`APP_PROJ`** must have a corresponding project makefile named [Makefile.p\*.app](#ch_proj.inside_app_make) in the project's source directory. When **make** is executed, these application project makefiles will be used along with `Makefile.app` and `Makefile.app.tmpl` to build the specified executables.

-   **`SUB_PROJ`** (optional) - a list of names for subproject directories (used on recursive makes).<br/>The **`SUB_PROJ`** macro is used to recursively define **make** targets; items listed here define the subdirectories rooted in the project's source directory where **make** should also be executed.

The `Makefile.in` meta file in the project's source directory defines a kind of road map that will be used by the **configure** script to generate a makefile (`Makefile`) in the corresponding directory of the `build` tree. `Makefile.in` does *not* participate in the actual execution of **make**, but rather, defines what will happen at that time by directing the **configure** script in the creation of the `Makefile` that **will** be executed (see also the description of [Makefile targets](ch_build.html#ch_build.std_build_targets)).

<a name="ch_proj.inside_example"></a>

#### An example meta-makefile and its associated project makefiles

A simple example should help to make this more concrete. Assuming that `myProj` is used to develop an application named `myProj`, `myProj/Makefile.in` should contain the following:

    ####### Example: src/myProj/Makefile.in
    APP_PROJ = myProj
    srcdir = @srcdir@
    include @builddir@/Makefile.meta

The last two lines in `Makefile.in` should always be exactly as shown here. These two lines specify **make** variable templates using the **`@var_name@`** syntax. When generating the corresponding makefile in the `build` directory, the **configure** script will substitute each identifier name bearing that notation with full path definitions.

The corresponding makefile in `build/myProj` generated by the **configure** script for this example will then contain:

    ####### Example: myBuild/build/myProj/Makefile
    # Generated automatically from Makefile.in by configure.
    APP_PROJ = myProj
    srcdir = /home/zimmerma/internal/c++/src/myProj
    include /home/zimmerma/internal/c++/myBuild/build/Makefile.meta

As demonstrated in this example, the **`@srcdir@`** and **`@builddir@`** aliases in the makefile template have been replaced with absolute paths in the generated makefile, while the definition of **`APP_PROJ`** is copied verbatim.

The only build target in this example is `myProj`. `myProj` is specified as an application - not a library - because it is listed under **`APP_PROJ`** rather than under **`LIB_PROJ`**. Accordingly, there must also be a file named `Makefile.myProj.app` in the `src/myProj` directory. A project's application makefile specifies:

-   **`APP`** - the name to be used for the resulting executable

-   **`OBJ`** - a list of object files to use in the compilation

-   **`LIB`** - a list of NCBI C++ Toolkit libraries to use in the linking

-   **`LIBS`** - a list of other libraries to use in the linking

There may be any number of application or library makefiles for the project, Each application should be listed under **`APP_PROJ`** and each library should be listed under **`LIB_PROJ`** in `Makefile.in`. A suitable application makefile for this simple example might contain just the following text:

    ####### Example: src/myProj/Makefile.myProj.app
    APP = myProj
    OBJ = myProj
    LIB = xncbi

In this simple example, the **`APP_PROJ`** definition in `Makefile.in` is identical to the definitions of both **`APP`** and **`OBJ`** in `Makefile.myProj.app`. This is not always the case, however, as the **`APP_PROJ`** macro is used to define which makefiles in the `src` directory should be used during compilation, while **`APP`** defines the name of the resulting executable and **`OBJ`** specifies the names of object files. (Project makefiles for applications are described in more detail [below](#ch_proj.inside_app_make).)

#### Executing make

Given these makefile definitions, executing `make all_r` in the `build` project subdirectory indirectly causes `build/Makefile.meta` to be executed, which sets the following chain of events in motion:

1.  For each `proj_name` listed in [USR\_PROJ](#ch_proj.inside_make_meta), `Makefile.meta` first tests to see if `Makefile.proj_name` is available in the current `build` directory, and if so, executes:<br/><br/>`make -f Makefile.proj_name builddir="$(builddir)"`<br/>`srcdir="$(srcdir)" $(MFLAGS)`<br/><br/>Otherwise, `Makefile.meta` assumes the required makefile is in the project's source directory, and executes:<br/><br/>`make -f $(srcdir)/Makefile.proj_name builddir="$(builddir)" srcdir="$(srcdir)" $(MFLAGS)`<br/><br/>In either case, the important thing to note here is that the commands contained in the project's makefiles are executed directly and are **not** combined with additional makefiles in the top-level `build` directory. The aliased **`srcdir`**, **`builddir`**, and **`MFLAGS`** are still available and can be referred to inside `Makefile.proj_name`. By default, the resulting libraries and executables are written to the `build` directory only.<br/>

2.  For each `lib_name` listed in [LIB\_PROJ](#ch_proj.inside_make_meta),<br/><br/>`make -f $(builddir)/Makefile.lib.tmpl`<br/><br/>is executed. This in turn specifies that `$(builddir)/Makefile.mk`, `$(srcdir)/Makefile.lib_name.lib`, and `$(builddir)/Makefile.lib` should be included in the generated makefile commands that actually get executed. The resulting libraries are written to the `build` subdirectory and copied to the `lib` subtree.

3.  For each **app\_name** listed in [APP\_PROJ](#ch_proj.inside_make_meta),<br/><br/>`make -f $(builddir)/Makefile.app.tmpl`<br/><br/>is executed. This in turn specifies that `$(builddir)/Makefile.mk`, `$(srcdir)/Makefile.app_name.app`, and `$(builddir)/Makefile.app` should be included in the generated makefile commands that actually get executed. The resulting executables are written to the `build` subdirectory and copied to the `bin` subtree.

4.  For each `dir_name` listed in [SUB\_PROJ](#ch_proj.inside_make_meta) (on `make all_r`),<br/><br/>`cd dir_name`<br/>`make all_r`<br/><br/>is executed. Steps (1) - (3) are then repeated in the project subdirectory.

More generally, for each subdirectory listed in **`SUB_PROJ`**, the **configure** script will create a relative subdirectory inside the new `build` project directory, and generate the new subdirectory's `Makefile` from the corresponding meta-makefile in the `src` subtree. Note that each subproject directory must also contain its own `Makefile.in` along with the corresponding project makefiles. The recursive make commands, `make all_r, make clean_r`, and `make purge_r` all refer to this definition of the subprojects to define what targets should be recursively built or removed.

<a name="ch_proj.inside_cust_make"></a>

#### Custom project makefile: Makefile.myProj ([\*](#ch_proj.usr_def_makefile))

As described, regular makefiles contained in the project's `src` directory will be invoked from the `build` directory if their suffixes are specified in the **`USR_PROJ`** macro. This macro is originally defined in the project's `src` directory in the `Makefile.in` meta file, and is propagated to the corresponding `Makefile` in the `build` directory by the **configure** script.

For example, if `USR_PROJ = myProj` in the `build` directory's `Makefile`, executing **make** will cause `Makefile.myProj` (the project makefile) to be executed. This project makefile may be located in either the current `build` directory **or** the corresponding `src` directory. In either case, although the makefile is executed directly, references to the source or object files (contained in the project makefile) must give complete paths to those files. In the first case, **make** is invoked as: `make -f Makefile.myProj`, so the makefile is located in the current working (`build`) directory but the source files are not. In the second case, **make** is invoked as:

`make -f $(srcdir)/Makefile.myProj`,

so both the project makefile **and** the source files are non-local. For example:

    ####### Makefile.myProj
    include $(NCBI)/ncbi.mk
    # use the NCBI default compiler for this platform
    CC = $(NCBI_CC)
    # along with the default include
    INCPATH = $(NCBI_INCDIR)
    # and library paths
    LIBPATH = $(NCBI_LIBDIR)
    all: $(srcdir)/myProj.c
        $(CC) -o myProj $(srcdir)/myProj.c $(NCBI_CFLAGS) -I($INCPATH) \
        -L($LIBPATH) -lncbi
        cp -p myProj $(builddir)/bin
    clean:
        -rm  myProj myProj.o
    purge: clean
        -rm  $(builddir)/bin/myProj

will cause the C program `myProj` to be built directly from `Makefile.myProj` using the default C compiler, library paths, include paths, and compilation flags defined in `ncbi.mk`. The executables and libraries generated from the targets specified in **`USR_PROJ`** are by default written to the current `build` directory only. In this example however, they are also explicitly copied to the `bin` directory, and accordingly, the `purge` directives also remove the copied executable.

<a name="ch_proj.inside_lib_make"></a>

#### Library project makefile: Makefile.myProj.lib ([\*](#ch_proj.make_proj_lib))

`Makefile.lib_name.lib` should contain the following macro definitions:

-   **`$(SRC)`** - the names of all source files to compile and include in the library

-   **`$(OBJ)`** - the names of any pre-compiled object files to include in the library

-   **`$(LIB)`** - the name of the library being built

In addition, any of the make variables defined in `build/Makefile.mk`, such as **`$CPPFLAGS`**, **`$LINK`**, etc., can be referred to and/or redefined in the project makefile, e.g.:

    CFLAGS   = $(ORIG_CFLAGS)   -abc -DFOOBAR_NOT_CPLUSPLUS
    CXXFLAGS = $(ORIG_CXXFLAGS) -xyz
    CPPFLAGS = $(ORIG_CPPFLAGS) -UFOO -DP1_PROJECT -I$(NCBI_C_INCLUDE)
    LINK     = purify $(ORIG_LINK)

For an example from the Toolkit, see [Makefile.corelib.lib](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/corelib/Makefile.corelib.lib).

For a more detailed example, including information about shared libraries, see [example 1 above](#ch_proj.make_proj_lib).

<a name="ch_proj.inside_app_make"></a>

#### Application project makefile: Makefile.myProj.app ([\*](#ch_proj.make_proj_app))

`Makefile.app_name.app` should contain the following macro definitions:

-   **`$(SRC)`** - the names of the object modules to build and link to the application

-   **`$(OBJ)`** - the names of any pre-compiled object files to include in the linking

-   **`$(LIB)`** - specific libraries in the NCBI C++ Toolkit to include in the linking

-   **`$(LIBS)`** - all other libraries to link to (outside the C++ Toolkit)

-   **`$(APP)`** - the name of the application being built

For example, if C Toolkit libraries should also be included in the linking, use:

    LIBS = $(NCBI_C_LIBPATH) -lncbi $(ORIG_LIBS)

The project's application makefile can also redefine the compiler and linker, along with other flags and tools affecting the build process, as described above for `Makefile.*.lib` files. For an example from the Toolkit, see [Makefile.coretest.app](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/corelib/test/Makefile.coretest.app), and for a documented example, see [example 2 above](#ch_proj.make_proj_app).

<a name="ch_proj.inside_tests"></a>

#### Defining and running tests

The definition and execution of unit tests is controlled by the **`CHECK_CMD`** macro in the test application's makefile, `Makefile.app_name.app`. If this macro is not defined (or commented out), then no test will be executed. If **`CHECK_CMD`** is defined, then the test it specifies will be included in the automated test suite and can also be invoked independently by running "`make check`" in the folder where the test makefile is situated. You also can run an individual test (if more than one test is located in the folder) by running: "`make check APP_PROJ=%name_of_the_test_to_run%`".

To include an application into the test suite it is necessary to add just one line into its makefile `Makefile.app_name.app`:

    CHECK_CMD =

or

    CHECK_CMD = command line to run application test

For the first form, where no command line is specified by the **`CHECK_CMD`** macro, the program specified by the makefile variable **`APP`** will be executed (without any parameters).

For the second form: If your application is executed by a script specified in a **`CHECK_CMD`** command line, and it doesn't read from `STDIN`, then the script should invoke it like this:

    $CHECK_EXEC app_name arg1 arg2 ...

If your application *does* read from `STDIN`, then **`CHECK_CMD`** scripts should invoke it like this:

    $CHECK_EXEC_STDIN app_name arg1 arg2 ...

***Note:*** Applications / scripts in the **`CHECK_CMD`** definition should **not** use "`.`", for example:

    $CHECK_EXEC ./app_name arg1 arg2 ... # Do not prefix app_name with ./

Scripts invoked via **`CHECK_CMD`** should pass an exit code to the testing framework via the **`exitcode`** variable, for example:

    exitcode=$?

If your test program needs additional files (for example, a configuration file, data files, or helper scripts referenced in **`CHECK_CMD`**), then set **`CHECK_COPY`** to point to them:

    CHECK_COPY = file1 file2 dir1 dir2

Before the tests are run, all specified files and directories will be copied to the build or special check directory (which is platform-dependent). Note that all paths to copied files and directories must be relative to the application source directory.

By default, the application's execution time is limited to 200 seconds. You can set a new limit using:

    CHECK_TIMEOUT = <time in seconds>

If application continues execution after specified time, it will be terminated and test marked as FAILED.

If you'd like to get nightly test results automatically emailed to you, add your email address to the **`WATCHERS`** macro in the makefile. Note that the **`WATCHERS`** macro has replaced the **`CHECK_AUTHORS`** macro which had a similar purpose.

#### The configure scripts

A number of [compiler-specific wrappers](ch_config.html#ch_config.Special_Consideratio) for different platforms are described in the chapter on [configuring and building](ch_config.html). Each of these wrappers performs some pre-initialization for the tools and flags used in the **configure** script before running it. The compiler-specific wrappers are in the [c++/compilers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/compilers) directory. The **configure** script serves two very different types of function: (1) it tests the selected compiler and environment for a multitude of features and generates `#include` and `#define` statements accordingly, and (2) it reads the `Makefile.in` files in the `src` directories and creates the corresponding `build` subtrees and makefiles accordingly.

Frequently during development it is necessary to make minor adjustments to the `Makefile.in` files, such as adding new projects or subprojects to the list of targets. In these contexts however, the compiler, environment, and source directory structures remain unchanged, and **configure** is actually doing much more work than is necessary. In fact, there is even some risk of failing to re-create the same configuration environment if the user does not exactly duplicate the same set of configure flags when re-running **configure**. In these situations, it is preferable to run an auxiliary script named [config.status](ch_config.html#ch_config.ch_configpre_built_h), located at the top level of the `build` directory in a subdirectory named `status`.

In contrast, changes to the `src` directory structure, or the addition/deletion of `Makefile.in` files, all require re-running the **configure** script, as these actions require the creation/deletion of subdirectories in the `build` tree and/or the creation/deletion of the associated `Makefile` in those directories.

### Working with the serializable object classes

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Serializable Objects](#ch_proj.ser_objects_intro)

-   [Locating and browsing serializable objects in the C++ Toolkit](#ch_proj.locate_ser_objects)

-   [Base classes and user classes](#ch_proj.base_classes)

-   [Adding methods to the user classes](#ch_proj.add_to_usr_classes)

    -   [Checking out source code, configuring the working environment, building the libraries](#ch_proj.src_code_work_env)

    -   [Adding methods](#ch_proj.proj_add_methods)

<a name="ch_proj.ser_objects_intro"></a>

#### Serializable Objects

All of the ASN.1 data types defined in the C Toolkit have been re-implemented in the C++ Toolkit as serializable objects. Header files for these classes can be found in the [include/objects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects) directories, and their implementations are located in the [src/objects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects) directories. and

The implementation of these classes as serializable objects has a number of implications. It must be possible to use expressions like: `instream >> myObject` and `outstream << myObject, `where specializations are entailed for the `serial format` of the iostreams (ASN.1, XML, etc.), as well as for the internal structure of the object. The C++ Toolkit deploys several [object stream classes](ch_ser.html#ch_ser.objstream.html) that specialize in various formats, and which know how to access and apply the [type information](ch_ser.html#ch_ser.typeinfo.html)that is associated with the serializable object.

The type information for each class is defined in a separate static [CTypeInfo](ch_ser.html#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_ctypeinfo_ref) object, which can be accessed by all instances of that class. This is a very powerful device, which allows for the implementation of many features generally found only in languages which have built-in class reflection. Using the Toolkit's serializable objects will require some familiarity with the usage of this type information, and several sections of this manual cover these topics (see [Runtime Object Type Information](ch_ser.html#ch_ser.typeinfo.html) for a general discussion).

<a name="ch_proj.locate_ser_objects"></a>

#### Locating and browsing serializable objects in the C++ Toolkit

The top level of the [include/objects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects) subtree is a set of subdirectories, where each subdirectory includes the public header files for a separately compiled library. Similarly, the [src/objects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects) subtree includes a set of subtrees containing the source files for these libraries. Finally, your `build/objects` directory will contain a corresponding set of build subtrees where these libraries are actually built.

If you checked out the entire C++ SVN tree, you may be surprised to find that initially, the `include/objects` subtrees are empty, and the subdirectories in the `src/objects` subtree contain only ASN.1 modules. This is because both the header files and source files are auto-generated from the ASN.1 specifications by the [datatool](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) program. As described in [Working within the C++ source tree](#ch_proj.inside_tree), you can build everything by running `make all_r` in the build directory.

***Note:*** If you would like to have the `objects` libraries built locally, you **must** use the `--with-objects` flag when running the **configure** script.

You can also access the pre-generated serializable objects in the public area, using the source browsers to locate the objects you are particularly interested in. For example, if you are seeking the new class definition for the `Bioseq struct` defined in the C Toolkit, you can search for the ***CBioseq*** class, using either the [LXR](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident) identifier search tool, or the Doxygen [class hierarchy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/hierarchy.html) browser. Starting with the name of the data object as it appears in the ASN.1 module, two simple rules apply in deriving the new C++ class name:

-   The one letter 'C' (for class) prefix should precede the ASN.1 name

-   All hyphens ('-') should be replaced by underscores ('\_')

For example, `Seq-descr `becomes ***CSeq\_descr***.

<a name="ch_proj.base_classes"></a>

#### Base classes and user classes

The classes whose names are derived in this manner are called the `user classes`, and each also has a corresponding `base class `implementation. The name of the `base class` is arrived at by appending `"_Base"` to the `user class` name. Most of the `user classes `are empty wrapper classes that do not bring any new functionality or data members to the inherited `base class`; they are simply provided as a platform for development. In contrast, the `base classes` are **not** intended for public use (other than browsing), and should never be modified.

More generally, the `base classes` should *never* be instantiated or accessed directly in an application. The relation between the two source files and the classes they define reflects a general design used in developing the object libraries: the base class files are auto-generated by [datatool](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) according to the ASN.1 specifications in the `src/objects` directories; the inherited class files (the so-called `user classes`) are intended for developers who can extend these classes to support features above and beyond the ASN.1 specifications.

Many applications will involve a "tangled hierarchy" of these objects, reflecting the complexity of the real world data that they represent. For example, a ***CBioseq\_set*** contains a list of ***CSeq\_entry*** objects, where each ***CSeq\_entry*** is, in turn, a [choice](ch_ser.html#ch_ser.choice.html) between a ***CBioseq*** and a ***CBioseq\_set***.

Given the potential for this complexity of interactions, a critical design issue becomes how one can ensure that methods which may have been defined only in the `user class` will be available for all instances of that class. In particular, these instances may occur as contained elements of another object which is compiled in a different library. These inter-object dependencies are the motivation for the `user classes`. As shown in [Figure 2](#ch_proj.F2), all references to external objects which occur inside the `base classes`, access external `user classes`, so as to include any methods which may be defined only in the `user classes`:

<a name="ch_proj.F2"></a>

[![Figure 2. Example of complex relationships between base classes and user classes](/cxx-toolkit/static/img/user_base.gif)](/cxx-toolkit/static/img/user_base.gif "Click to see the full-resolution image")

Figure 2. Example of complex relationships between base classes and user classes

In most cases, adding non-virtual methods to a `user class` will **not** require re-compiling any libraries except the one which defines the modified object. Note however, that adding non-static data members and/or `virtual` methods to the `user classes `**will change** the class layouts, and in these cases only, will entail recompiling any external library objects which access these classes.

<a name="ch_proj.add_to_usr_classes"></a>

#### Adding methods to the user classes

***Note:*** This section describes the steps currently required to add new methods to the `user classes`. It is subject to change, and there is no guarantee the material here is up-to-date. In general, it is not recommended practice to add methods to the `user classes`, unless your purpose is to extend these classes across all applications as part of a development effort.

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Checking out source code, configuring the working environment, building the libraries.](#ch_proj.src_code_work_env)

-   [Adding methods](#ch_proj.proj_add_methods)

<a name="ch_proj.src_code_work_env"></a>

##### Checking out source code, configuring the working environment, building the libraries

-   Create a working directory (e.g. `Work`) and check out the C++ tree to that directory:, using either SVN checkout or the shell script, [`svn_core`](ch_getcode_svn.html#ch_getcode_svn.core_sh).

-   [Configure](ch_config.html#ch_config.Running_the_configur) the environment to work inside this tree using one of the configure scripts, according to the platform you will be working on. Be sure to include the `--with-objects` flag in invoking the **configure** script.

-   Build the `xncbi`, `xser` and `xser` libraries, and run `datatool` to create the objects header and source files, and build all of the object module libraries:

<!-- -->

    # Build the core library
    cd path_to_compile_dir/build/corelib
    make
    # Build the util library
    cd path_to_compile_dir/build/util
    make
    # might as well build datatool and avoid possible version skew cd path_to_compile_dir/build/serial make all_r
    # needed for a few projects
    cd path_to_compile_dir/build/connect
    make
    cd path_to_compile_dir/build/objects
    make all_r

<br/>Here **`path_to_compile_dir`** is set to the compile work directory which depends on the compiler settings (e.g: `~/Work/internal/GCC-Debug`). In addition to creating the header and source files, using `make all_r `(instead of just **make**) will build all the libraries. All libraries that are built are also copied to the `lib` dir, e.g.:`~/Work/internal/c++/GCC-Debug/lib`. Similarly, all executables (such as **asn2asn**) are copied to the bin dir, e.g.: `~/Work/internal/c++/GCC-Debug/bin`.

You are now ready to edit the user class files and add methods.

<a name="ch_proj.proj_add_methods"></a>

##### Adding methods

As an example, suppose that we would like to add a method to the ***CSeq\_inst*** class to calculate sequence length, e.g.:***CSeq\_inst::CalculateLength()***. We begin by adding a declaration of this method to the public section of the user class definition in `Seq_inst.hpp`:

    class CSeq_inst : public CSeq_inst_Base
    {
    public:
        CSeq_inst(void);
        ~CSeq_inst(void);
        static CSeq_inst* New(void)
            {
                return new CSeq_inst(eCanDelete);
            }
        int CalculateLength() const;
    protected:
        CSeq_inst(ECanDelete);
    };

and in the source file, `Seq_inst.cpp`, we implement

    int CSeq_inst::CalculateLength() const
    {
        // implementation goes here
    }

These files are in the [include/objects/seq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects/seq) and [src/objects/seq](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects/seq) subdirectories, respectively. Once you have made the modifications to the files, you need to recompile the `seq` library, `libseq.a`, i.e.:

    cd path_to_compile_dir/GCC-Debug/build/objects/seq
    make

Here **`path_to_compile_dir `**is set to the compile work directory which depends on the compiler settings (e.g: `~/Work/internal/GCC-Debug`). The new method can now be invoked from within a ***CBioseq*** object as: `myBioseq.GetInst().CalculateLength().`

The key issue that determines whether or not you will need to rebuild any `external` libraries that use the modified user class involves the class layout in memory. All of the external libraries which reference the object refer to the class layout that existed prior to the changes you have made. Thus, if your modifications do **not** affect the class layout, you do not have to rebuild any external libraries. Changes that *do* affect memory mapping include:

-   The addition of new, non-static data members

-   The addition of virtual methods

If you have added either of the above to the `user class`, then you will need to identify all external objects which use your object, and recompile the libraries in which these objects are defined.
