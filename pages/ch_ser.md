14\. Data Serialization (ASN.1, XML, JSON)
==================================================

Last Update: April 7, 2015.

The SERIAL API [Library `xserial`:[include](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/serial) \| [src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/serial)]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The overview for this chapter consists of the following topics:

-   Introduction

-   Chapter Outline

### Introduction

The Serial library provides a means for loading, accessing, manipulating, and serialization of data in a formatted way. It supports serialization in [ASN.1](http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/languages/) (text or BER encoding), [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML), and [JSON](http://json.org) formats. See also the [DATATOOL documentation](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) discussion of generating C++ code for serializable objects from the corresponding ASN.1 definition.

The structure of data is described by some sort of formal language. In our case it can be ASN.1, DTD or XML Schema. Based on such specification, [DATATOOL](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) application, which is part of NCBI C++ toolkit, generates a collection of data storage classes that can be used to store and serialize data. The design purpose was to make these classes as lightweight as possible, moving all details of serialization into specialized classes - [“object streams”](#ch_ser.objstream.html_intro). Structure of the data is described with the help of [“type information”](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html). Data objects contain data and type information only. Any such data storage object can be viewed as a node tree that provides random access to its data. The Serial library provides a means of [traversing](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_cobjinfo) this data tree without knowing its structure in advance – using only type information; C++ code generated by DATATOOL makes it possible to access any child node directly.

[“Object streams”](#ch_ser.objstream.html_intro) are intermediaries between data storage objects and input or output stream. They perform encoding or decoding of data according to format specifications. Guided by the type information embedded into data object, on reading they allocate memory when needed, fill in data, and validate that all mandatory data is present; on writing they guarantee that all relevant data is written and that the resulting document is well-formed. All it takes to read or write a top-level data object is one function call – all the details are handled by an object stream.

Closely related to serialization is the task of converting data from one format into another. One approach could be reading data object completely into memory and then writing it in another format. The only problem is that the size of data can be huge. To simplify this task and to avoid storing data in memory, the serial library provides the [“object stream copier”](#ch_ser.objstream.html_objcopy) class. It reads data by small chunks and writes it immediately after reading. In addition to small memory footprint, it also works much faster.

Input data can be very large in size; also, reading it completely into memory could not be the goal of processing. Having a large file of data, one might want to investigate information containers only of a particular type. Serial library provides a variety of means for doing this. The list includes [read](#ch_ser.objstream.html_readhooks) and [write](#ch_ser.objstream.html_writehooks) hooks, several types of [stream iterators](#ch_ser.stream_iterators), and [filter templates](#ch_ser.serial_filter). It is worth to note that, when using read hooks to read child nodes, one might end up with an invalid top-level data object; or, when using write hooks, one might begin with an invalid object and fill in missing data on the fly – in hooks.

In essence, “hook” is a callback function that client application provides to serial library. Client application installs the hook, then reads (or writes) data object, and somewhere from the depths of serialization processing, the library calls this hook function at appropriate times, for example, when a data chunk of specified type is about to be read. It is also possible to install [context-specific hooks](#ch_ser.stack_path_hooks). Such hooks are triggered when serializing a particular object type in a particular structural context; for example, for all objects of class A which are contained in object B.

### Format Specific Streams: The ***CObject[IO]Stream*** classes

The reading and writing of serialized data objects entails satisfying two independent sets of constraints and specifications: (1) `format-specific` parsing and encoding schemes, and (2) `object-specific` internal structures and rules of composition. The NCBI C++ Toolkit implements serial IO processes by combining a set of `object stream` classes with an independently defined set of `data object` classes. These classes are implemented in the `serial` and `objects` directories respectively.

The base classes for the object stream classes are [CObjectIStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStream.html) and [CObjectOStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStream.html). Each of these base classes has derived subclasses which specialize in different formats, including XML, binary ASN.1, text ASN.1, and JSON. A simple example program, `xml2asn.cpp` (see [Code Sample 1](#ch_ser.xml2asn_cpp.html)), described in [Processing serial data](#ch_ser.asn.html_example1), uses these object stream classes in conjunction with a ***CBiostruct*** object to translate a file from XML encoding to ASN.1 formats. In this chapter, we consider in more detail the class definitions for object streams, and how the [type information](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_ctypeinfo_ref) associated with the data is used to implement serial input and output.

<a name="ch_ser.xml2asn_cpp.html"></a>

#### Code Sample 1. xml2asn.cpp

    // File name: xml2asn.cpp
    // Description: Reads an XML Biostruc file into memory
    //      and saves it in ASN.1 text and binary formats.

    #include <corelib/ncbistd.hpp>
    #include <corelib/ncbiapp.hpp>
    #include <serial/serial.hpp>
    #include <serial/objistr.hpp>
    #include <serial/objostr.hpp>
    #include <objects/mmdb1/Biostruc.hpp>

    USING_NCBI_SCOPE;

    class CTestAsn : public CNcbiApplication {
    public:
        virtual int Run ();
    };

    using namespace objects;

    int CTestAsn::Run() {
        auto_ptr<CObjectIStream>
            xml_in(CObjectIStream::Open("1001.xml", eSerial_Xml));
        auto_ptr<CObjectOStream>
            txt_out(CObjectOStream::Open("1001.asntxt", eSerial_AsnText));
        auto_ptr<CObjectOStream>
            bin_out(CObjectOStream::Open("1001.asnbin", eSerial_AsnBinary));
        CBiostruc bs;
        *xml_in >> bs;
        *txt_out << bs;
        *bin_out << bs;
        return 0;
    }

    int main(int argc, const char* argv[])
    {
        CNcbiOfstream diag("asntrans.log");
        SetDiagStream(&diag);
        CTestAsn theTestApp;
        return theTestApp.AppMain(argc, argv);
    }

Each object stream specializes in a serial data format and a direction (in/out). It is not until the input and output operators are applied to these streams, in conjunction with a specified serializable object, that the object-specific type information comes into play. For example, if **`instr`** is a ***CObjectIStream***, the statement: `instr >> myObject` invokes a ***Read()*** method associated with the input stream, whose sole argument is a [CObjectInfo](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_cobjinfo) for **`myObject`**.

Similarly, the output operators, when applied to a ***CObjectOstream*** in conjunction with a serializable object, will invoke a ***Write()*** method on the output stream which accesses the object's type information. The object's type information defines what tag names and value types should be encountered on the stream, while the ***CObject[IO]Stream*** subclasses specialize the data serialization format.

The input and output operators (`<<` and `>>`) are declared in [serial/serial.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/serial/serial.hpp) header.

### The ***CObjectIStream*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStream.html)) classes

***CObjectIStream*** is the base class for the [CObjectIStreamXml](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStreamXml.html), [CObjectIStreamAsn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStreamAsn.html),
[CObjectIStreamAsnBinary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStreamAsnBinary.html), and
[CObjectIStreamJson](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStreamJson.html)
classes. As such, it has no public constructors, and its user interface includes the following methods:

-   ***Open()***

-   ***Close()***

-   ***GetDataFormat()***

-   ***ReadFileHeader()***

-   ***Read()***

-   ***ReadObject()***

-   ***ReadSeparateObject()***

-   ***Skip()***

-   ***SkipObject()***

There are several ***Open()*** methods; most of these are static class methods that return a pointer to a newly created ***CObjectIStream***. Typically, these methods are used with an ***auto\_ptr***, as in:

    auto_ptr<CObjectIStream> xml_in(CObjectIStream::Open(filename, eSerial_Xml));

Here, an XML format is specified by the enumerated value **`eSerial_Xml`**, defined in [ESerialDataFormat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=ESerialDataFormat). Because these methods are static, they can be used to create a new instance of a ***CObjectIStream*** subclass, and open it with one statement. In this example, a [CObjectIStreamXml](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStreamXml.html) is created and opened on the file **`filename`**.

An additional non-static ***Open()*** method is provided, which can only be invoked as a member function of a previously instantiated object stream (whose format type is of course, implicit to its class). This method takes a ***CNcbiIstream*** and a flag indicating whether or not ownership of the ***CNcbiIstream*** should be transferred (so that it can be deleted automatically when the object stream is closed):

    void Open(CNcbiIstream& inStream, EOwnership deleteInStream = eNoOwnership);

The next three methods have the following definitions. ***Close()*** closes the stream. ***GetDataFormat()*** returns the enumerated ***ESerialDataFormat*** for the stream. ***ReadFileHeader()*** reads the first line from the file, and returns it in a string. This might be used for example, in the following context:

    auto_ptr<CObjectIStream> in(CObjectIStream::Open(fname, eSerial_AsnText));
    string type = in.ReadFileHeader();
    if (type.compare("Seq-entry") == 0) {
        CSeq_entry seqent;
        in->Read(ObjectInfo(seqent), eNoFileHeader);
        // ...
    }
    else if (type.compare("Bioseq-set") == 0) {
        CBioseq_set seqset;
        in->Read(ObjectInfo(seqset), eNoFileHeader);
        // ...
    }

<a name="idp37787824"></a>

> The ***ReadFileHeader()*** method for the base ***CObjectIStream*** class returns an empty string. Only those stream classes which specialize in ASN.1 text or XML formats have actual implementations for this method.

Several ***Read\*()*** methods are provided for usage in different contexts. ***CObjectIStream::Read()*** should be used for reading a top-level "root" object from a data file. For convenience, the input operator `>>`, as described above, indirectly invokes this method on the input stream, using a [CObjectTypeInfo](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_cobjinfo) object derived from **`myObject`**. By default, the ***Read()*** method first calls ***ReadFileHeader()***, and then calls ***ReadObject()***. Accordingly, calls to ***Read()*** which follow the usage of ***ReadFileHeader()*****must** include the optional **`eNoFileHeader`** argument.

Most data objects also contain embedded objects, and the default behavior of ***Read()*** is to load the top-level object, along with all of its contained subobjects into memory. In some cases this may require significant memory allocation, and it may be only the top-level object which is needed by the application. The next two methods, [ReadObject()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=ReadObject) and [ReadSeparateObject()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=ReadSeparateObject), can be used to load subobjects as either persistent data members of the root object or as temporary local objects. In contrast to ***Read()***, these methods assume that there is no file header on the stream.

As a result of executing `ReadObject(member)`, the newly created subobject will be instantiated as a member of its parent object. In contrast, `ReadSeparateObject(local)`, instantiates the subobject in the local temporary variable only, and the corresponding data member in the parent object is set to an appropriate `null` representation for that data type. In this case, an attempt to reference that subobject after exiting the scope where it was created generates an error.

The ***Skip()*** and ***SkipObject()*** methods allow entire top-level objects and subobjects to be "skipped". In this case the input is still read from the stream and validated, but no object representation for that data is generated. ***Skip()*** should only be applied to top-level objects. As with the ***Read()*** method, the optional ***ENoFileHeader*** argument can be included if the file header has already been extracted from the data stream. `SkipObject(member)` may be applied to subobjects of the root object.

All of the ***Read*** and ***Skip*** methods are like wrapper functions, which define what activities take place immediately before and after the data is actually read. How and when the data is then loaded into memory is determined by the object itself. Each of the above methods ultimately calls `objTypeInfo->ReadData()` or `objTypeInfo->SkipData()`, where **`objTypeInfo`** is the static type information object associated with the data object. This scheme allows the user to install type-specific read, write, and copy hooks, which are described below. For example, the default behavior of loading all subobjects of the top-level object can be modified by installing appropriate read hooks which use the ***ReadSeparateObject()*** and ***SkipObject()*** methods where needed.

<a name="ch_ser.objstream.html_objostr"></a>

### The ***CObjectOStream*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStream.html)) classes

The output object stream classes mirror the ***CObjectIStream*** classes. The ***CObjectOStream*** base class is used to derive the [CObjectOStreamXml](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStreamXml.html), [CObjectOStreamAsn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStreamAsn.html), [CObjectOStreamAsnBinary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStreamAsnBinary.html), and
[CObjectOStreamJson](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStreamJson.html), and
classes. There are no public constructors, and the user interface includes the following methods:

-   ***Open()***

-   ***Close()***

-   ***GetDataFormat()***

-   ***WriteFileHeader()***

-   ***Write()***

-   ***WriteObject()***

-   ***WriteSeparateObject()***

-   ***Flush()***

-   ***FlushBuffer()***

Again, there are several ***Open()*** methods, which are static class methods that return a pointer to a newly created ***CObjectOstream***:

    static CObjectOStream* Open(ESerialDataFormat format,
                                CNcbiOstream &outStream,
                                EOwnership deleteOutStream=eNoOwnership,
                                TSerial_Format_Flags formatFlags=0)

    static CObjectOStream* Open(ESerialDataFormat format,
                                const string &fileName,
                                TSerialOpenFlags openFlags=0,
                                TSerial_Format_Flags formatFlags=0)

    static CObjectOStream* Open(const string &fileName,
                                ESerialDataFormat format,
                                TSerial_Format_Flags formatFlags=0)

The ***Write\*()*** methods correspond to the ***Read\*()*** methods defined for the input streams. ***Write()*** first calls ***WriteFileHeader()***, and then calls ***WriteObject()***. ***WriteSeparateObject()*** can be used to write a temporary object (and all of its children) to the output stream. It is also possible to install type-specific `write` hooks. Like the ***Read()*** methods, these ***Write()*** methods serve as wrapper functions that define what occurs immediately before and after the data is actually written.

<a name="ch_ser.objstream.html_objcopy"></a>

### The ***CObjectStreamCopier*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectStreamCopier.html)) classes

The ***CObjectStreamCopier*** class is neither an input nor an output stream class. Rather, it is a helper class, which allows to "pass data through" without storing the intermediate objects in memory. Its sole constructor is:

    CObjectStreamCopier(CObjectIStream& in, CObjectOStream& out);

and its most important method is the ***Copy(CObjectTypeInfo&)*** method, which, given an object's description, reads that object from the input stream and writes it to the output stream. The serial formats of both the input and output object streams are implicit, and thus the translation between two different formats is performed automatically.

In keeping with the ***Read*** and ***Write*** methods of the ***CObjectIStream*** and ***CObjectOStream*** classes, the ***Copy*** method takes an optional ***ENoFileHeader*** argument, to indicate that the file header is not present in the input and should not be generated on the output. The ***CopyObject()*** method corresponds to the ***ReadObject()*** and ***WriteObject()*** methods.

As an example, consider how the ***Run()*** method in [xml2asn.cpp](#ch_ser.xml2asn_cpp.html) might be implemented differently using the ***CObjectStreamCopier*** class:

    int CTestAsn::Run() {
        auto_ptr<CObjectIStream>
            xml_in(CObjectIStream::Open("1001.xml", eSerial_Xml));
        auto_ptr<CObjectOStream>
            txt_out(CObjectOStream::Open("1001.asntxt", eSerial_AsnText));
        CObjectStreamCopier txt_copier(*xml_in, *txt_out);
        txt_copier.Copy(CBiostruc::GetTypeInfo());
        auto_ptr<CObjectOStream>
            bin_out(CObjectOStream::Open("1001.asnbin", eSerial_AsnBinary));
        CObjectStreamCopier bin_copier(*xml_in, *bin_out);
        bin_copier.Copy(CBiostruc::GetTypeInfo());
        return 0;
    }

It is also possible to install type-specific ***Copy*** hooks. Like the ***Read*** and ***Write*** methods, the ***Copy*** methods serve as wrapper functions that define what occurs immediately before and after the data is actually copied.

### Type-specific I/O routines – the hook classes

Much of the functionality needed to read and write serializable objects may be type-specific yet application-driven. Because the specializations may vary with the application, it does not make sense to implement fixed methods, yet we would like to achieve a similar kind of object-specific behavior.

To address these needs, the C++ Toolkit provides hook mechanisms, whereby the needed functionality can be installed with the object's static class [type information](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_ctypeinfo_ref) object. Local hooks apply to a selected stream whereas global hooks apply to all streams. ***Note:*** global skip hooks are not supported.

For any given object type, stream, and processing mode (e.g. reading), at most one hook is "active". The active hook for the current processing mode will be called when objects of the given type are encountered in the stream. For example, suppose that local and global hooks have been set for a given object type. Then if a read occurs on the stream for which the local hook was set, the local hook will be called, otherwise the global hook will be called. Designating multiple read/write hooks (both local and global) for a selected object does not generate an error. Older or less specific hooks are simply overridden by the more specific or most recently installed hook.

Understanding and creating hooks properly relies on three distinct concepts:

-   **Structural Context** – the criteria for deciding which objects in the stream will be hooked.

-   **Processing Mode** – what is being done when the hook should be called. Hooks will only be called in the corresponding processing mode. For example, if content is being skipped, only skip hooks will be called. If the mode changes to reading, then only read hooks will be called.

-   **Operation** – easily confused with processing mode, the operation is what is done inside the hook, not what is being done when the hook is called.

***Note:*** The difference between processing mode and operation can be very confusing. It is natural to think, for example, "I want to read Bioseq id's" without considering how the stream is being processed. The next natural step is to conclude "I want a read hook" - but that could be incorrect. Instead, one should think "I want to *read* a Bioseq id *inside* a hook". Only then should the processing mode be chosen, and it may not match the operation performed inside the hook. The processing mode should be chosen based on what should be done with the *rest* of the stream and whether or not it's necessary to retain the data *outside* the hook. For example, if you want to read Bioseq id's and don't care about anything else, then you should probably choose the 'skip' processing mode (meaning you would use a skip hook), and *within* the skip hook you would *read* the Bioseq id. Or, if you wanted to read entire Bioseq's for later analysis while automatically building a list of Bioseq id's, you would have to use the 'read' processing mode (and therefore a read hook) to save the data for later analysis. Inside the read hook you would use a read operation (to save the data) and at the same time you would have access to the id for building the list of id's.

There are three main **structural contexts** in which an object might be encountered in a stream:

<a name="ch_ser.T.nc_ContextDescriptionObjectWhen"></a>

| Context        | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Object         | When the stream object matches a specified type – for example, the ***Bioseq*** type.                                                         |
| Class Member   | When the stream object matches a specified member of a specified `SEQUENCE` type – for example, the **`id`** member of the ***Bioseq*** type. |
| Choice Variant | When the stream object matches a specified variant of a specified `CHOICE` type – for example, the **`std`** variant of the ***Date*** type.  |

<div class="table-scroll"></div>

Complex structural contexts can be created by nesting the main structural contexts. For example, a [stack path hook](#ch_ser.stack_path_hooks) can apply to a specific class member, but only when it is nested inside another specified class member. Stack path hooks also make it possible to hook objects only within a limited level of nesting - for example, hooking only the highest-level Seq-entry's. For more details see the [stack path hook](#ch_ser.stack_path_hooks) section.

There are four **processing modes** that can be applied to input/output streams:

<a name="ch_ser.T.nc_ModeDescriptionReadWhen_obje"></a>

| Mode  | Description                                                                              |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read  | When objects are parsed from an input stream and a deserialized instance is retained.    |
| Skip  | When objects are parsed from an input stream but a deserialized instance is not retained |
| Copy  | When objects are parsed from an input stream and written directly to an output stream.   |
| Write | When objects are written to an output stream.                                            |

<div class="table-scroll"></div>

The **operation** is not restricted to a limited set of choices. It can be any application-specific task, as long as that task is compatible with the processing mode. For example, a skip operation can be performed inside a read hook, provided that the skipped content is optional for the object being read. Similarly, a read operation can be performed inside a skip hook. The operation performed inside a hook must preserve the integrity of the hooked object, and must advance the stream all the way through the hooked object and no farther.

Hooks can be installed for all combinations of structural context and processing mode. Each combination has a base class that defines a pure virtual method that must be defined in a derived class to implement the hook – e.g. the ***CReadObjectHook*** class defines a pure virtual ***ReadObject()*** method. The definition of the overriding method in the derived class is often referred to as "the hook".

<a name="ch_ser.T.nc_ObjectClass_MemberChoice_Var"></a>

|                        | Object                                               | Class Member                                                    | Choice Variant                                                      |

<div class="table-scroll"></div>

In addition, there is a [hook guard](#ch_ser.objstream.html_hookguard) class, which simplifies creating any of the above hooks. There are also [stack path hook](#ch_ser.stack_path_hooks) methods corresponding to each structural context / processing mode combination above, making it easy to create hooks for virtually any conceivable situation.

#### Hook Sample

Here is a complete program that illustrates how to create a read hook for class members (other sample programs are available at <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/viewvc/v1/trunk/c++/src/sample/app/serial/>):

    #include <ncbi_pch.hpp>
    #include <objects/general/Date_std.hpp>
    #include <serial/objistr.hpp>
    #include <serial/serial.hpp>

    USING_NCBI_SCOPE;
    USING_SCOPE(ncbi::objects);

    // This class implements a read hook for class members.
    //
    // A read hook is created by passing a new instance of this class to a
    // "set hook" method.  Hooks may be created as global or local.  Global hooks
    // apply to all streams, whereas local hooks are associated with a specific
    // stream.  Thus, the "set hook" methods for creating class member read hooks
    // are:
    //     SetGlobalReadHook()
    //     SetLocalReadHook()
    //
    // This class must override the virtual method ReadClassMember().  See the
    // comment for the ReadClassMember() method below for more details.
    //
    // In principle, multiple instances of this hook class could be used to provide
    // the same hook processing for more than one entity.  However, it is probably
    // best to create a separate class for each "thing" you want to hook and
    // process.
    //
    // You should adopt a meaningful naming convention for your hook classes.
    // In this example, the convention is C<mode><context>Hook_<object>__<member>
    // where:   <mode>=(Read|Write|Copy|Skip)
    //          <context>=(Obj|CM|CV)  --  object, class member, or choice variant
    // and hyphens in ASN.1 object types are replaced with underscores.
    //
    // Note:  Since this is a read hook, ReadClassMember() will only be called when
    // reading from the stream.  If the stream is being skipped, ReadClassMember()
    // will not be called.  If you want to use a hook to read a specific type of
    // class member while skipping everything else, use a skip hook and call
    // DefaultRead() from within the SkipClassMember() method.
    //
    // Note: This example is a read hook, which means that the input stream is
    // being read when the hook is called.  Hooks for other processing modes
    // (Write, Skip, and Copy) are similarly created by inheriting from the
    // respecitive base classes.  It is also a ClassMember hook.  Hooks for
    // other structural contexts (Object and ChoiceVariant) a similarly derived
    // from the appropriate base.
    class CDemoHook : public CReadClassMemberHook
    {
    public:
        // Implement the hook method.
        //
        // Once the read hook has been set, ReadClassMember() will be called
        // whenever the specified class member is encountered while
        // reading a hooked input stream.  Without the hook, the encountered
        // class member would have been automatically read.  With the hook, it is
        // now the responsibility of the ReadClassMember() method to remove the
        // class member from the input stream and process it as desired.  It can
        // either read it or skip it to remove it from the stream.  This is
        // easily done by calling DefaultRead() or DefaultSkip() from within
        // ReadClassMember().  Subsequent processing is up to the application.
        virtual void ReadClassMember(CObjectIStream& in,
                                     const CObjectInfoMI& passed_info)
        {
            // Perform any pre-read processing here.
            //NcbiCout << "In ReadClassMember() hook, before reading." << NcbiEndl;

            // You must call DefaultRead() (or perform an equivalent operation)
            // if you want the object to be read into memory.  You could also
            // call DefaultSkip() if you wanted to skip the hooked object while
            // reading everything else.
            DefaultRead(in, passed_info);

            // Perform any post-read processing here.  Once the object has been
            // read, its data can be used for processing. For example, here we dump
            // the read object into the standard output.
            NcbiCout << MSerial_AsnText << passed_info.GetClassObject();
        }
    };

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        // Create some ASN.1 data that can be parsed by this code sample.
        char asn[] = "Date-std ::= { year 1998 }";

        // Setup an input stream, based on the sample ASN.1.
        CNcbiIstrstream iss(asn);
        auto_ptr<CObjectIStream> in(CObjectIStream::Open(eSerial_AsnText, iss));

        ////////////////////////////////////////////////////
        // Create a hook for the 'year' class member of Date-std objects.
        // The year class member was aribtrarily chosen to illustrate the
        // use of hooks - many other entities would work equally well.

        // Get data structures that model the type information for Date-std
        // objects and their 'year' class members.
        // The type information will be used to recognize and forward 'year'
        // class members of Date-std objects found in the stream to the hook.
        CObjectTypeInfo typeInfo = CType<CDate_std>();
        CObjectTypeInfoMI memberInfo = typeInfo.FindMember("year");

        // Set a local hook for Date-std 'year' class members.  This involves
        // creating an instance of the hook class and passing that hook to the
        // "set hook" method, which registers the hook to be called when a hooked
        // type is encountered in the stream.
        memberInfo.SetLocalReadHook(*in, new CDemoHook);


        // The above three statements could be shortened to:
        //CObjectTypeInfo(CType<CDate_std>()).FindMember("year")
        //                                   .SetLocalReadHook(*in, new CDemoHook);


        // Read from the input stream, storing data in the object.  At this point,
        // the hook is in place so simply reading from the input stream will
        // cause the hook to be triggered whenever the 'year' class member is
        // encountered.
        CDate_std my_date;
        *in >> my_date;

        return 0;
    }

#### Read mode hooks

All of the different structural contexts in which an object might be encountered on an input stream can be reduced to three cases:

-   as a stand-alone object

-   as a data member of a containing object

-   as a variant of a `choice` object

Hooks can be installed for each of the above contexts, depending on the desired level of specificity. Corresponding to these contexts, three abstract base classes provide the foundations for deriving new `Read` hooks:

-   ***CReadObjectHook***

-   ***CReadClassMemberHook***

-   ***CReadChoiceVariantHook***

Each of these base hook classes exists only to define a pure virtual ***Read*** method, which can then be implemented (in a derived subclass) to install the desired type of read hook. If the goal is to apply the new ***Read*** method in all contexts, then the new hook should be derived from the ***CReadObjectHook*** class, and registered with the object's static type information object. For example, to install a new ***CReadObjectHook*** for a ***CBioseq***, one might use:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CBioseq::GetTypeInfo()).
        SetLocalReadHook(*in, myReadBioseqHook);

Another way of installing hooks of any type (read/write/copy, object/member/variant) is provided by ***CObjectHookGuard*** class described below.

Alternatively, if the desired behavior is to trigger the specialized ***Read*** method only when the object occurs as a data member of a particular containing class, then the new hook should be derived from the ***CReadClassMemberHook***, and registered with that member's type information object:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CBioseq::GetTypeInfo()).
        FindMember("Seq-inst").SetLocalReadHook(*in, myHook);

Similarly, one can install a read hook that will only be triggered when the object occurs as a choice variant:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CSeq_entry::GetTypeInfo()).
        FindVariant("Bioseq").SetLocalReadHook(*in, myReadBioseqHook);

The new hook classes for these examples should be derived from ***CReadObjectHook***, ***CReadClassMemberHook***, and ***CReadChoiceVariantHook***, respectively. In the first case, all occurrences of ***CBioseq*** on any input stream will trigger the new ***Read*** method. In contrast, the third case installs this new ***Read*** method to be triggered only when the ***CBioseq*** occurs as a choice variant in a ***CSeq\_entry*** object.

All of the virtual ***Read*** methods take two arguments: a ***CObjectIStream*** and a reference to a [CObjectInfo](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objinfo). For example, the ***CReadObjectHook*** class declares the ***ReadObject()*** method as:

    virtual void ReadObject(CObjectIStream& in,
                            const CObjectInfo& object) = 0;

The ***ReadClassMember*** and ***ReadChoiceVariant*** hooks differ from the ***ReadObject*** hook class, in that the second argument to the virtual ***Read*** method is an iterator, pointing to the object type information for a sequence member or choice variant respectively.

In summary, to install a read hook for an object type:

derive a new class from the appropriate hook class:

-   if the hook should be called regardless of the structural context in which the target object occurs, use the ***CReadObjectHook*** class.

-   if the target object occurs as a sequence member, use the ***CReadClassMemberHook*** class.

-   if the target object occurs as a choice variant, use the ***CReadChoiceVariant Hook*** class.

implement the virtual ***Read*** method for the new class.

install the hook, using the ***SetLocalReadHook()*** method defined in

-   ***CObjectTypeInfo*** for a ***CReadObjectHook***

-   ***CMemberInfo*** for a ***CReadClassMemberHook***

-   ***CVariantInfo*** for a ***CReadChoiceVariantHook***

or use ***CObjectHookGuard*** class to install any of these hooks.

In many cases you will need to read the hooked object and do some special processing, or to skip the entire object. To simplify object reading or skipping all base hook classes have ***DefaultRead()*** and ***DefaultSkip()*** methods taking the same arguments as the user provided ReadXXXX() methods. Thus, to read a bioseq object from a hook:

    void CMyReadObjectHook::ReadObject(CObjectIStream& in,
                                       const CObjectInfo& object)
    {
        DefaultRead(in, object);
        // Do some user-defined processing of the bioseq
    }

Note that skipping choice variant leaves the choice object in an uninitialized state. In general, hooks should be used with care as it is very easy to leave some data of the top level object uninitialized.

##### Read Object Hook Sample

A read object hook can be created very much like other hooks. For example, the executable lines in the [hook sample](#ch_ser.Hook_Sample), can be replaced with:

    #include <ncbi_pch.hpp>
    #include <objects/general/Date_std.hpp>
    #include <serial/objistr.hpp>
    #include <serial/serial.hpp>

    USING_NCBI_SCOPE;
    USING_SCOPE(ncbi::objects);

    class CDemoHook : public CReadObjectHook
    {
    public:
        virtual void ReadObject(CObjectIStream& strm,
                                const CObjectInfo& passed_info)
        {
            DefaultRead(strm, passed_info);
        }
    };

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        char asn[] = "Date-std ::= { year 1998 }";
        CNcbiIstrstream iss(asn);
        auto_ptr<CObjectIStream> in(CObjectIStream::Open(eSerial_AsnText, iss));

        CObjectTypeInfo(CType<CDate_std>()).SetLocalReadHook(*in, new CDemoHook());

        CDate_std my_date;
        *in >> my_date;

        return 0;
    }

##### Read Class Member Hook Sample

A read class member hook can be created very much like other hooks. For an example, see the [hook sample](#ch_ser.Hook_Sample).

See the [class documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCReadClassMemberHook.html) for more information.

<a name="ch_ser.Read_Choice_Variant_Hook_Sample"></a>

##### Read Choice Variant Hook Sample

A read choice variant hook can be created very much like other hooks. For example, the executable lines in the [hook sample](#ch_ser.Hook_Sample), can be replaced with:

    #include <ncbi_pch.hpp>
    #include <objects/general/Date.hpp>
    #include <serial/objistr.hpp>
    #include <serial/serial.hpp>

    USING_NCBI_SCOPE;
    USING_SCOPE(ncbi::objects);

    class CDemoHook : public CReadChoiceVariantHook
    {
    public:
        virtual void ReadChoiceVariant(CObjectIStream& strm,
                                       const CObjectInfoCV& passed_info)
        {
            DefaultRead(strm, passed_info);
        }
    };

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        char asn[] = "Date ::= str \"late-spring\"";
        CNcbiIstrstream iss(asn);
        auto_ptr<CObjectIStream> in(CObjectIStream::Open(eSerial_AsnText, iss));

        CObjectTypeInfo(CType<CDate>()).FindVariant("str")
                                       .SetLocalReadHook(*in, new CDemoHook);

        CDate my_date;
        *in >> my_date;

        return 0;
    }

<a name="ch_ser.objstream.html_writehooks"></a>

#### Write mode hooks

The `Write` hook classes parallel the `Read` hook classes, and again, we have three base classes:

-   ***CWriteObjectHook***

-   ***CWriteClassMemberHook***

-   ***CWriteChoiceVariantHook***

These classes define the pure virtual methods:

    CWriteObjectHook::WriteObject(CObjectOStream&,
        const CConstObjectInfo& object) = 0;

    CWriteClassMemberHook::WriteClassMember(CObjectOStream&,
        const CConstObjectInfoMI& member) = 0;

    CWriteChoiceVariantHook::WriteChoiceVariant(CObjectOStream&,
        const CConstObjectInfoCV& variant) = 0;

Like the read hooks, your derived write hooks can be installed by invoking the ***SetLocalWriteObjectHook()*** methods for the appropriate type information objects. Corresponding to the examples for read hooks then, we would have:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CBioseq::GetTypeInfo()).
        SetLocalWriteHook(*in, myWriteBioseqHook);

    CObjectTypeInfo(CBioseq::GetTypeInfo()).
        FindMember("Seq-inst").SetLocalWriteHook(*in, myWriteSeqinstHook);

    CObjectTypeInfo(CSeq_entry::GetTypeInfo()).
        FindVariant("Bioseq").SetLocalWriteHook(*in, myWriteBioseqHook);

***CObjectHookGuard*** class provides is a simple way to install write hooks.

##### Write Object Hook Sample

A write object hook can be created very much like other hooks. For example, the executable lines in the [hook sample](#ch_ser.Hook_Sample), can be replaced with:

    class CDemoHook : public CWriteObjectHook
    {
    public:
        virtual void WriteObject(CObjectOStream& out,
                                 const CConstObjectInfo& passed_info)
        {
            DefaultWrite(out, passed_info);
        }
    };

    int main(int argc, char** argv)
    {
        auto_ptr<CObjectIStream> in(CObjectIStream::Open(eSerial_AsnText, "if"));
        auto_ptr<CObjectOStream> out(CObjectOStream::Open(eSerial_AsnText, "of"));

        CObjectTypeInfo(CType<CCit_art>()).SetLocalWriteHook(*out, new CDemoHook);

        CCit_art article;
        *in >> article;
        *out << article;

        return 0;
    }

##### Write Class Member Hook Sample

A write class member hook can be created very much like other hooks. For example, the executable lines in the [hook sample](#ch_ser.Hook_Sample), can be replaced with:

    #include <ncbi_pch.hpp>
    #include <objects/biblio/Auth_list.hpp>

#### Copy mode hooks

As with the `Read` and `Write` hook classes, there are three base classes which define the following `Copy` methods:

    CCopyObjectHook::CopyObject(CObjectStreamCopier& copier,
        const CObjectTypeInfo& object) = 0;

    CCopyClassMemberHook::CopyClassMember(CObjectStreamCopier& copier,
        const CObjectTypeInfoMI& member) = 0;

    CCopyChoiceVariantHook::CopyChoiceVariant(CObjectStreamCopier& copier,
        const CObjectTypeInfoCV& variant) = 0;

Newly derived copy hooks can be installed by invoking the ***SetLocalCopyObjectHook()*** method for the appropriate type information object. The other way of installing hooks is described below in the ***CObjectHookGuard*** section.

To do default copying of an object in the overloaded hook method each of the base copy hook classes has a ***DefaultCopy()*** method.

#### Skip mode hooks

As with the `Read` and `Write` hook classes, there are three base classes which define the following `Skip` methods:

    CSkipObjectHook::SkipObject(CObjectIStream& in,
        const CObjectTypeInfo& object) = 0;

    CSkipClassMemberHook::SkipClassMember(CObjectIStream& in,
        const CObjectTypeInfoMI& member) = 0;

    CSkipChoiceVariantHook::SkipChoiceVariant(CObjectIStream& in,
        const CObjectTypeInfoCV& variant) = 0;

Newly derived skip hooks can be installed by invoking the ***SetLocalSkipObjectHook()*** method for the appropriate type information object. The other way of installing hooks is described below in the ***CObjectHookGuard*** section.

The ***CSkipObjectHook*** class has a ***DefaultSkip()*** method, like the base classes for the other processing modes, but for historical reasons ***DefaultSkip()*** methods were not defined for the ***CSkipClassMemberHook*** and ***CSkipChoiceVaraintHook*** classes. Nevertheless, achieving the same result is easily accomplished – for example:

    class CMySkipClassMemberHook : public CSkipClassMemberHook
    {
    public:
        virtual void SkipClassMember(CObjectIStream& in,
                                     const CObjectTypeInfoMI& member)
        {

<a name="ch_ser.objstream.html_hookguard"></a>

#### The ***CObjectHookGuard*** class

To simplify hooks usage ***CObjectHookGuard*** class may be used. It's a template class: the template parameter is the class to be hooked (in case of member or choice variant hooks it's the parent class of the member).

The CObjectHookGuard class has several constructors for installing different hook types. The last argument to all constructors is a stream pointer. By default the pointer is NULL and the hook is intalled as a global one. To make the hook stream-local pass the stream to the guard constructor.

-   Object read/write hooks:<br/>`CObjectHookGuard(CReadObjectHook& hook,`<br/>`                 CObjectIStream* in = 0);`<br/>`CObjectHookGuard(CWriteObjectHook& hook,`<br/>`                 CObjectOStream* out = 0);`

-   Class member read/write hooks:<br/>`CObjectHookGuard(string id,`<br/>`                 CReadClassMemberHook& hook,`<br/>`                 CObjectIStream* in = 0);`<br/>`CObjectHookGuard(string id,`<br/>`                 CWriteClassMemberHook& hook,`<br/>`                 CObjectOStream* out = 0);`

The string "id" argument is the name of the member in ASN.1 specification for generated classes.

-   Choice variant read/write hooks:<br/>`CObjectHookGuard(string id,`<br/>`                 CReadChoiceVariantHook& hook,`<br/>`                 CObjectIStream* in = 0);`<br/>`CObjectHookGuard(string id,`<br/>`                 CWriteChoiceVariantHook& hook,`<br/>`                 CObjectOStream* out = 0);`

The string "id" argument is the name of the variant in ASN.1 specification for generated classes.

The guard's destructor will uninstall the hook. Since all hook classes are derived from CObject and stored as CRef\<\>-s, the hooks are destroyed automatically when uninstalled. For this reason it's recommended to create hook objects on heap.

<a name="ch_ser.stack_path_hooks"></a>

#### Stack Path Hooks

When an object is serialized or deserialized, a string called the stack path is created internally to track the structural context of the current location. The stack path starts with the type name of the top-level data object. While each sub-object is processed, a '`.`' and the sub-object name are "pushed onto the stack".

Stack path hooks enable to hook complex structural contexts by nesting the main structural contexts - for example, a specific nesting pattern of class members. Stack path hooks also make it possible to hook objects only within a limited level of nesting - for example, the [hooks\_highest\_se\_objs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/sample/app/serial/hooks_highest_se_objs.cpp) sample program shows how to hook only the highest-level Seq-entry's.

An example of a possible stack path string is:

    Seq-entry.set.seq-set.seq.annot.data.ftable.data.pub.pub.article

Hooks based on the stack path can be created if you need to specify a more complex structural context for when a hook should be called. More complex, that is, than the "object", "class member", and "choice variant" contexts discussed in earlier sections. For example, "I want to hook the reading of objects named 'title' when and only when they are contained by objects named 'book', not all occurrences of 'title' objects", or, "I want to hook the reading of all sequence members named 'title' in all objects, not only in a specific one". The serial library makes it possible to set hooks for such structural contexts by passing a stack path mask to various "SetHook" methods. When the stack path string for the object being processed matches the stack path mask, the hook will be called.

The general form of the stack path mask is:

    TypeName.Member1.Member2.HookedMember

More formally:

    StackPathMask ::= (TypeName | Wildcard) ('.' (MemberName | Wildcard))+

Here `TypeName` and `MemberName` are strings; '`.`' separates path elements; and `Wildcard` is defined as:

    Wildcard ::= ('?' | '*')

The question mark means "match exactly one path element with any name", while the asterisk means "match one or more path elements with any names".

An example of a possible stack path mask is:

    *.article.*.authors

***Note:*** The first element of the stack path mask must be either a wildcard or the type of the top-level object in the stream. Type names are not permitted anywhere but the first element, which makes stack path masks like "`*.Cit-book.*.date`" invalid (ASN.1 type names begin with uppercase while member names begin with lowercase).

As with regular serialization hooks, it is possible to install a path hook for a specific object:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CBioseq::GetTypeInfo()).
        SetPathReadHook(in, path, myReadBioseqHook);

a member of a sequence object:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CBioseq::GetTypeInfo()).FindMember("inst").
        SetPathReadHook(in, path, myReadSeqinstHook);

or a variant of a choice object:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CSeq_entry::GetTypeInfo()).FindVariant("seq").
        SetPathReadHook(in, path, myReadBioseqHook);

Here **`in`** is a pointer to an input object stream. If it is equal to zero, the hook will be installed globally, otherwise - for that particular stream.

In addition, it is possible to install path hooks directly in object streams without specifying an ASN.1 type. For example, to install a read hook on all string objects named **`last-name`**, one could use either this:

    CObjectTypeInfo(CStdTypeInfo<string>::GetTypeInfo()).
        SetPathReadHook(in,"*.last-name",myObjHook);

or this:

    in->SetPathReadObjectHook("*.last-name", myObjHook);

Setting path hooks directly in streams also makes it possible to differentiate between **`last-name`** being a sequence member and choice variant. So, for example:

    in->SetPathReadMemberHook("*.last-name", myMemHook);

will hook sequence members and not choice variants, while:

    in->SetPathReadVariantHook("*.last-name", myVarHook);

will hook choice variants and not sequence members.

Stack path hooks can be removed by passing **`NULL`** instead of a hook pointer to the various "SetHook" methods.

<a name="ch_ser.Hooking_anonymous_objects"></a>

#### Hooking anonymous objects

Certain ASN.1 constructs result in anonymous objects. For example, in this ASN.1 specification:

    Bioseq-set ::= SEQUENCE {
        -- skipping other class members
        seq-set SEQUENCE OF Seq-entry

the seq-set class member contains anonymous Seq-entry objects. You can hook the complete sequence using the name "seq-set", but there is no name to use to hook the individual Seq-entry elements of the sequence.

The solution is to hook the seq-set container and iterate through the elements using the ***CIStreamContainerIterator*** class. For example:

    class CSkipMemberHook__Bioseq_set : public CSkipClassMemberHook
    {
    public:
        virtual void SkipClassMember(CObjectIStream& stream,
                                     const CObjectTypeInfoMI& info)
        {
            // The whole container is hooked, so we have to iterate
            // to access the contained elements.
            CIStreamContainerIterator iter(stream, info.GetMemberType());
            for ( ; iter; ++iter) {
                CSeq_entry entry;
                iter >> entry;  // read individual elements
                Process(entry); // process as desired
            }
        }
    };
    ...
            // This is how to hook the container:
            in->SetPathSkipMemberHook("Bioseq-set.seq-set",
                                      new CSkipMemberHook__Bioseq_set());
    ...
            // Skip through the stream, triggering the hook:
            in->Skip(CType<CBioseq_set>());

***Note:*** Hooking ASN.1 "SET OF" works the same way as "SEQUENCE OF".

<a name="ch_ser.stream_iterators"></a>

### Stream Iterators

When working with a stream, it is sometimes convenient to be able to read or write data elements directly, bypassing the standard data storage mechanism. For example, when reading a large container object, the purpose could be to process its elements. It is possible to read everything at once, but this could require a lot of memory to store the data in. An alternative approach, which greatly reduces the amount of required memory, could be to read elements one by one, process them as they arrive, and then discard. Or, when writing a container, one could construct it in memory only partially, and then add missing elements 'on the fly' - where appropriate. To make it possible, the SERIAL library introduces `stream iterators`. Needless to say, the most convenient way of using this mechanism is in read/write hooks.

SERIAL library defines the following stream iterator classes: ***CIStreamClassMemberIterator*** and ***CIStreamContainerIterator*** for input streams, and ***COStreamClassMember*** and ***COStreamContainer*** for output ones.

Reading a container could look like this:

    for ( CIStreamContainerIterator it(in, containerType); it; ++it ) {
          CElementClass element;
          it >> element;
    }

Writing - like this:

    set<CElementClass> container;  // your container
    ...
    COStreamContainer osc(out, containerType);
    ITERATE(set<CElementClass>, it, container) {
        const CElementClass& element = *it;

### The ***ByteBlock*** and ***CharBlock*** classes

***CObject[IO]Stream::ByteBlock*** class may be used for non-standard processing of an OCTET STRING data, e.g. from a read/write hooks. The ***CObject[IO]Stream::CharBlock*** class has almost the same functionality, but may be used for VisibleString data processing.

An example of using ByteBlock or CharBlock classes is generating data on-the-fly in a write hook. To use block classes:

Initialize the block variable with an i/o stream and, in case of output stream, the length of the block.

Use Read()/Write() functions to process block data

Close the block with the End() function

Below is an example of using ***CObjectOStream::ByteBlock*** in an object write hook for non-standard data processing. Note, that ByteBlock and CharBlock classes read/write data only. You should also provide some code for writing class' and members' tags.

Since OCTET STRING and VisibleString in the NCBI C++ Toolkit are implemented as ***vector\<char\>*** and ***string*** classes, which have no serailization type info, you can not install a read or write hook for these classes. The example also demonstrates how to process members of these types using the containing class hook. Another example of using CharBlock with write hooks can be found in [test\_serial.cpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/serial/test/test_serial.cpp) application.

    void CWriteMyObjectHook::WriteObject(CObjectOStream& out,
                                         const CConstObjectInfo& object)
    {
        const CMyObject& obj = *reinterpret_cast<const CMyObject*>
            (object.GetObjectPtr());
        if ( NothingToProcess(obj) ) {
            // No special processing - use default write method
            DefaultWrite(out, object);
            return;
        }
        // Write object open tag
        out.BeginClass(object.GetClassTypeInfo());
        // Iterate object members
        for (CConstObjectInfo::CMemberIterator member =
            object.BeginMembers(); member; ++member) {
            if ( NeedProcessing(member) ) {
                // Write the special member manually
                out.BeginClassMember(member.GetMemberInfo()->GetId());
                // Start byte block, specify output stream and block size
                size_t length = GetRealDataLength(member);
                CObjectOStream::ByteBlock bb(out, length);
                // Processing and output
                for (int i = 0; i < length; ) {
                    char* buf;
                    int buf_size;
                    // Assuming ProcessData() generates the data from "member",
                    // starting from position "i" and stores the data to "buf"
                    ProcessData(member, i, &buf_size, &buf);
                    i += buf_size;
                    bb.Write(buf, buf_size);
                }
            }
            // Close the byte block
            bb.End();
            // Close the member
            out.EndClassMember();
        }
        else {
            // Default writer for members without special processing
            if ( member.IsSet() )
                out.WriteClassMember(member);
        }
        // Close the object
        out.EndClass();

### NCBI C++ Toolkit Network Service (RPC) Clients

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Introduction and Use](#ch_ser.data_ser_2_1)

-   [Implementation Details](#ch_ser.data_ser_2_2)

<a name="ch_ser.data_ser_2_1"></a>

#### Introduction and Use

The C++ Toolkit now contains [datatool](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool)-generated classes for certain ASN.1-based network services: at the time of this writing, `Entrez2`, `ID1`, and `MedArch`. (There is also an independently written class for the `Taxon1` service, [CTaxon1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CTaxon1&d=C), which this page does not discuss further.) All of these classes, declared in headers named `objects/.../client(_).hpp`, inherit certain useful properties from the base template [CRPCClient\<\>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CRPCClient&d=C):

-   They normally defer connection until the first actual query, and disconnect automatically when destroyed, but let users request either action explicitly.

-   They are designed to be thread-safe (but, at least for now, maintain only a single connection per instance, so forming pools may be appropriate).

The usual interface to these classes is through a family of methods named ***AskXxx***, each of which takes a request of an appropriate type and an optional pointer to an object that will receive the full reply and returns the corresponding reply choice. For example, ***CEntrez2Client::AskEval\_boolean*** takes a request of type ***const CEntrez2\_eval\_boolean&*** and an optional pointer of type ***CEntrez2\_reply\****, and returns a reply of type ***CRef\<CEntrez2\_boolean\_reply\>***. All of these methods automatically detect server-reported errors or unexpected reply choices, and throw appropriate exceptions when they occur. There are also lower-level methods simply named ***Ask***, which may come in handy if you do not know what kind of query you will need to make.

In addition to these standard methods, there are certain class-specific methods: ***CEntrez2Client*** adds ***GetDefaultRequest*** and ***SetDefaultRequest*** for dealing with those fields of ***Entrez2-request*** besides **`request`** itself, and ***CID1Client*** adds ***{Get,Set}AllowDeadEntries*** (off by default) to control how to handle the result choice **`gotdeadseqentry`**.

<a name="ch_ser.data_ser_2_2"></a>

#### Implementation Details

In order to get [datatool](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) to generate classes for a service, you must add some settings to the corresponding `modulename.def` file. Specifically, you must set **`[-]clients`** to the relevant base file name (typically `service``_client`), and add a correspondingly named section containing the entries listed in [Table 1](#ch_ser.T1). (If a single specification defines multiple protocols for which you would like **datatool** to generate classes, you may list multiple client names, separated by spaces.)

### Verification of Class Member Initialization

When serializing an object, it is important to verify that all mandatory primitive data members (e.g. strings, integers) are given a value. The NCBI C++ Toolkit implements this through a data initialization verification mechanism. In this mechanism, the value itself is not validated; that is, it still could be semantically incorrect. The purpose of the verification is only to make sure that the member has been assigned some value. The verification also provides for a possibility to check whether the object data member has been initialized or not. This could be useful when constructing such objects in memory.

From this perspective, each data member (XXX) of a serial object generated by **DATATOOL** from an ASN or XML specification has the ***IsSetXXX()*** and ***CanGetXXX()*** methods. Also, input and output streams have ***SetVerifyData()*** and ***GetVerifyData()*** methods. The purpose of ***CanGetXXX()*** method is to answer the question whether it is safe or not to call the corresponding ***GetXXX()***. The meaning of ***IsSetXXX()*** is whether the data member has been assigned a value explicitly (using assignment function call, or as a result of reading from a stream) or not. The stream's ***SetVerifyData()*** method defines a stream behavior in case it comes across an uninitialized data member.

There are several kinds of object data members: *optional* with and without a default value, *mandatory* with and without a default value, and *nillable*. Optional and mandatory members with no default have "no value" initially. As such, they are "ungetatable"; that is, ***GetXXX()*** throws an exception (this is also configurable though). Members with a default are always getable, but not always set. It is possible to assign a default value to a member with a default using ***SetDefaultXXX()*** method. The characteristic of *nillable* members is that they are allowed to be "unset" during serialization. That is, they are allowed to have "no value" (or, have *NULL* value). One can assign *NULL* value to a member using ***ResetXXX()*** method.

The discussion above refers only to primitive data members, such as strings, or integers. The behavior of containers is somewhat different. All containers are pre-created on the parent object construction, so for container data members ***CanGetXXX()*** always returns TRUE. This can be justified by the fact that containers have a sort of "natural default value" - empty. Also, ***IsSetXXX()*** will return TRUE if the container is either mandatory, or has been read (even if empty) from the input stream, or ***SetXXX()*** was called for it.

The following table summarizes **IsSet/CanGet** behavior:

| Member is  | Simple data type (bool, int, string) | Simple with default | Serial object (CRef) | Container |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IsSet returns   | false/true | false/true | true for mandatory, false/true for others | false/true |
| CanGet returns  | IsSet()  | true  | true  | true  |

The following additional topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Initialization Verification in CSerialObject Classes](#ch_ser.serial_object_api)

-   [Initialization Verification in Object Streams](#ch_ser.serial_stream_api)

<a name="ch_ser.serial_object_api"></a>

#### Initialization Verification in ***CSerialObject*** Classes

***CSerialObject*** defines two functions to manage how uninitialized data members would be treated:

        static void SetVerifyDataThread(ESerialVerifyData verify);
        static void SetVerifyDataGlobal(ESerialVerifyData verify);

The ***SetVerifyDataThread()*** defines the behavior of ***GetXXX()*** for the current thread, while the ***SetVerifyDataGlobal()*** for the current process. Please note, that disabling ***CUnassignedMember*** exceptions in ***GetXXX()*** function is potentially dangerous because it could silently return garbage.

The behavior of initialization verification has been designed to allow for maximum flexibility. It is possible to define it using environment variables, and then override it in a program, and vice versa. It is also possible to force a specific behavior, no matter what the program sets, or could set later on. The ***ESerialVerifyData*** enumerator could have the following values:

-   `eSerialVerifyData_Default`

-   `eSerialVerifyData_No`

-   `eSerialVerifyData_Never`

-   `eSerialVerifyData_Yes`

-   `eSerialVerifyData_Always`

Setting ***eSerialVerifyData\_Never*** or ***eSerialVerifyData\_Always*** results in a "forced" behavior: setting ***eSerialVerifyData\_Never*** prohibits later attempts to enable verification; setting ***eSerialVerifyData\_Always*** prohibits attempts to disable it. The default behavior could be defined from the outside, using the **`SET_VERIFY_DATA_GET`** environment variable:

        SET_VERIFY_DATA_GET ::= ( 'NO' | 'NEVER' | 'YES' | 'ALWAYS' )

Alternatively, the default behavior can also be set from a program code using ***CSerialObject::SetVerifyDataXXX()*** functions.

Setting the environment variable to "Never/Always" overrides any attempt to change the verification behavior in the program. Setting "Never/Always" for the process overrides attempts to change it for a thread. "Yes/No" setting is less restrictive: the environment variable, if present, provides the default, which could then be overridden in a program, or thread. Here thread settings supersede the process ones.

<a name="ch_ser.serial_stream_api"></a>

#### Initialization Verification in Object Streams

Data member verification in object streams is a bit more complex.

First, it is possible to set the verification behavior on three different levels:

-   for a specific stream (***SetVerifyData()***),

-   for all streams created by the current thread (***SetVerifyDataThread()***),

-   for all stream created by the current process (***SetVerifyDataGlobal()***).

Second, there are more options in defining what to do in case of an uninitialized data member:

-   throw an exception;

-   skip it on writing (write nothing), and leave uninitialized (as is) on reading;

-   write some default value on writing, and assign it on reading (even though there is no default).

To accommodate these situations, the ***ESerialVerifyData*** enumerator has two additional values:

-   `eSerialVerifyData_DefValue`

-   `eSerialVerifyData_DefValueAlways`

In this case, on reading a missing data member, stream initializes it with a "default" (usually 0); on writing the unset data member, it writes it "as is". For comparison: in the "No/Never" case on reading a missing member stream could initialize it with a "garbage", while on writing it writes nothing. The latter case produces semantically incorrect output, but preserves information of what has been set, and what is not set.

The default behavior could be set similarly to CSerialObject. The environment variables are as follows:

        SET_VERIFY_DATA_READ  ::= ( 'NO' | 'NEVER' | 'YES' | 'ALWAYS' |
     'DEFVALUE' | 'DEFVALUE_ALWAYS' )
        SET_VERIFY_DATA_WRITE ::= ( 'NO' | 'NEVER' | 'YES' | 'ALWAYS' |
     'DEFVALUE' | 'DEFVALUE_ALWAYS' )

### Simplified Serialization Interface

The reading and writing of serial object requires creation of special object streams which encode and decode data. While such streams provide with a greater flexibility in setting the formatting parameters, in some cases it is not needed - the default behavior is quite enough. NCBI C++ toolkit library makes it possible to use the standard I/O streams in this case, thus hiding the creation of object streams. So, the serialization would look like this:

    cout << MSerial_AsnText << obj;

The only information that is always needed is the output format. It is defined by the following stream manipulators:

-   ***MSerial\_AsnText***

-   ***MSerial\_AsnBinary***

-   ***MSerial\_Json***

-   ***MSerial\_Xml***

-   ***MSerial\_Format(ESerialDataFormat fmt)***

Few additional manipulators define the handling of un-initialized object data members, skipping unknown members or valiants policy, and default string encoding:

-   ***MSerial\_VerifyDefault***

-   ***MSerial\_VerifyNo***

-   ***MSerial\_VerifyYes***

-   ***MSerial\_VerifyDefValue***

-   ***MSerial\_VerifyData(ESerialVerifyData fmt)***

-   ***MSerial\_SkipUnknownMembers(ESerialSkipUnknown fmt)***

-   ***MSerial\_SkipUnknownVariants(ESerialSkipUnknown fmt)***

-   ***MSerialXml\_DefaultStringEncoding(EEncoding fmt)***

Finally, it is possible to reset all formatting flags using ***MSerial\_None*** manipulator.

<a name="ch_ser.serial_filter"></a>

### Finding in input stream objects of a specific type

When processing serialized data, it is pretty often that one has to find all objects of a specific type, with this type not being a root one. To make it easier, serial library defines a helper template function ***Serial\_FilterObjects***. The idea is to be able to define a special hook class with a single virtual function ***Process*** with a single parameter: object of the requested type. Input stream is being scanned then, and, when an object of the requested type is encountered, the user-supplied function is being called.

For example, suppose an input stream contains Bioseq objects, and you need to find and process all Seq-inst objects in it. First, you need to define a class that will process them:

    Class CProcessSeqinstHook : public
    CSerial_FilterObjectsHook<CSeq_inst>
    {
    public:
        virtual void Process(const CSeq_inst& obj);
    };

Second, you just call filtering function specifying the root object type:

    Serial_FilterObjects<CBioseq>(input_stream, new
    CProcessSeqinstHook());

Another variant of this function – ***Serial\_FilterStdObjects*** – finds objects of standard type, not derived from ***CSerialObject*** – strings, for example. The usage is similar. First, define a hook class that will process data:

    class CProcessStringHook : public CSerial_FilterObjectsHook<string>
    {
    public:
        virtual void Process(const string& obj);
    };

Then, call the filtering function:

    Serial_FilterStdObjects<CBioseq>(input_stream, new CProcessStringHook());

An even more sophisticated, yet easier to use mechanism relies on multi-threading. It puts data reading into a separate thread and hides synchronization issues from client application. There are two template classes, which make it possible: ***CIStreamObjectIterator*** and ***CIStreamStdIterator***. The former finds objects of ***CSerialObject*** type:

    CIStreamObjectIterator<CBioseq,CSeq_inst> i(input_stream);
    for ( ; i.IsValid(); ++i) {
        const CSeq_inst& obj = *i;
        ...
    }

The latter – objects of standard type:

    CIStreamStdIterator<CBioseq,string> i(input_stream);
    for ( ; i.IsValid(); ++i) {
        const string& obj = *i;
        ...
    }

<a name="ch_ser.Reading_and_writing_binary_JSON_d"></a>

### Reading and writing binary JSON data

JSON is a purely text format - that is, all data values are string representations. Therefore, binary data cannot be serialized or deserialized as JSON without specifying an encoding. Furthermore, the encoding choice is not automatically stored with the encoded data, so the (de)serialization process must explicitly select an encoding.

The following code shows how to read binary JSON data:

    // Create JSON data with a Base64 encoded binary field.
    char jsonb[] = "{ \"Seq_data\": { \"ncbi2na\": \"ASNFZ4mrze8=\" } }";
    CNcbiIstrstream iss(jsonb);

    // Read the JSON data into a Seq-data object, using Base64 encoding.
    CObjectIStreamJson ijson;
    ijson.Open(iss);
    CSeq_data mySeq_data;
    ijson.SetBinaryDataFormat(CObjectIStreamJson::eString_Base64);
    ijson >> mySeq_data;

The following code shows how to write binary JSON data:

    // Use ASN.1 data to populate a Seq-data object.
    char asn[] = "Seq-data ::= ncbi2na '0123456789ABCDEF'H";
    CNcbiIstrstream iss(asn);
    auto_ptr<CObjectIStream> in(CObjectIStream::Open(eSerial_AsnText, iss));
    CSeq_data mySeq_data;
    *in >> mySeq_data;

    // Write the Seq-data object in JSON format with Base64 binary encoding.
    CObjectOStreamJson ojson(cout, false);
    ojson.SetBinaryDataFormat(CObjectOStreamJson::eString_Base64);
    ojson << mySeq_data;

### `STL` generic iterators

Iterators are an important cornerstone in the generic programming paradigm - they serve as intermediaries between generic containers and generic algorithms. Different containers have different access properties, and the interface to a generic algorithm must account for this.

The ***vector*** class allows `input, output, bidirectional,` and `random access` iterators. In contrast, the ***list*** container class does **not** allow random access to its elements. This is depicted graphically by one less strand in the ribbon connector. In addition to the iterators, the generic algorithms may require function objects such as `less<T>` to support the template implementations.

The STL standard iterators are designed to iterate through any STL container of homogeneous elements, e.g., `vectors, lists, deques, stacks, maps, multimaps, sets, multisets, `etc. A prerequisite however, is that the container must have ***begin()*** and ***end()*** functions defined on it as start and end points for the iteration.

But while these standard iterators are powerful tools for generic programming, they are of no help in iterating over the elements of `aggregate` objects - e.g., over the heterogeneous data members of a class object. As this is an essential operation in processing serialized data structures, the NCBI C++ Toolkit provides additional types of iterators for just this purpose. In the section on [Runtime object type information](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html), we described the [CMemberIterator](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objtype) and [CVariantIterator](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objtype) classes, which provide access to the instance and type information for **all** of the sequence members and choice variants of a sequence or choice object. In some cases however, we may wish to visit only those data members which are of a certain type, and do not require any type information. The iterators described in this section are of this type.

<a name="ch_ser.iterators.html_typeIt"></a>

### ***CTypeIterator*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCTypeIterator.html)) and ***CTypeConstIterator*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCTypeConstIterator.html))

The ***CTypeIterator*** and ***CTypeConstIterator*** can be used to traverse a structured object, stopping at all data members of a specified type. For example, it is very common to represent a linked list of objects by encoding a next field that embeds an object of the same type. One way to traverse the linked list then, would be to "iterate" over all objects of that type, beginning at the head of the list. For example, suppose you have a ***CPerson*** class defined as:

    class CPerson
    {
    public:
        CPerson(void);
        CPerson(const string& name, const string& address, CPerson* p);
        virtual ~CPerson(void);
        static const CTypeInfo* GetTypeInfo(void);
        string m_Name, m_Addr;
        CPerson *m_NextDoor;
    };

Given this definition, one might then define a **`neighborhood`** using a single ***CPerson***. Assuming a function ***FullerBrushMan(CPerson&)*** must now be applied to each person in the neighborhood, this could be implemented using a ***CTypeIterator*** as follows:

    CPerson neighborhood("Moe", "123 Main St",
                         new CPerson("Larry", "127 Main St",
                         new CPerson("Curly", "131 Main St", 0)));
    for (CTypeIterator<CPerson> house(Begin(neighborhood)); house; ++house ) {
        FullerBrushMan(*house);
    }

In this example, the data members visited by the iterator are of the same type as the top-level aggregate object, since **`neighbor`** is an instance of ***CPerson***. Thus, the first "member" visited is the top-level object itself. This is not always the case however. The top-level object is only included in the iteration when it is an instance of the type specified in the template argument (***CPerson*** in this case).

All of the NCBI C++ Toolkit type iterators are `recursive`. Thus, since **`neighborhood`** has ***CPerson*** data members, which in turn contain objects of type ***CPerson***, all of the nested data members will also be visited by the above iterator. More generally, given a hierarchically structured object containing data elements of a given type nested several levels deep, the NCBI C++ Toolkit type iterators effectively generate a "flat" list of all these elements.

It is not difficult to imagine situations where recursive iterators such as the ***CTypeIterator*** could lead to infinite loops. An obvious example of this would be a doubly-linked list. For example, suppose ***CPerson*** had both **`previous`** and **`next`** data members, where `x->next->previous == x`. In this case, visiting **`x`** followed by **`x->next`** would lead back to **`x`** with no terminating condition. To address this issue, the ***Begin()*** function accepts an optional second argument, [eDetectLoops](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=EDetectLoops). **`eDetectLoops`** is an `enum` value which, if included, specifies that the iterator should detect and avoid infinite loops. The resulting iterator will be somewhat slower but can be safely used on objects whose references might create loops.

Let's compare the syntax of this new iterator class to the traditional iterators:

    ContainerType<T> x;

    // a traditional approach:
    for (ContainerType<T>::IteratorType it = x.begin(); it != x.end(); ++it)

    // it's generally better to use ITERATOR:
    ITERATE(ContainerType<T> it, x)

    // or you can use CTypeIterator:
    for (CTypeIterator<T> it(Begin(ObjectName)); it; ++it)

The traditional for loop iteration begins by pointing to the first item in the container ***x.begin()***, and with each iteration, visits subsequent items until the end of the container ***x.end()*** is reached.

The **`ITERATE`** macro does essentially the same thing, but it saves ***x.end()*** instead of re-evaluating it every iteration.

Similarly, the ***CTypeIterator*** begins by pointing to the first data member of **`ObjectName`** that is of type ***T***, and with each iteration, visits subsequent data members of type ***T*** until the end of the top-level object is reached.

A lot of code actually uses `= Begin(...)` instead of `(Begin(...))` to initialize iterators; although the alternate syntax is somewhat more readable and often works, some compilers can mis-handle it and give you link errors. As such, direct initialization as shown above generally works better. Also, note that this issue only applies to construction; you should (and must) continue to use `=` to reset existing iterators.

How are generic iterators such as these implemented? The [Begin()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=Begin) expression returns an object containing a pointer to the input object **`ObjectName`**, as well as a pointer to a [CTypeInfo](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_ctypeinfo_ref) object containing `type information` about that object. On each iteration, the `++` operator examines the **current** type information to find the next data member which is of type ***T***. The current object, its type information, and the state of iteration is pushed onto a local stack, and the iterator is then reset with a pointer to the next object found, and in turn, a pointer to its type information. Each data member of type ***T*** (or derived from type ***T***) must be capable of providing its own type information as needed. This allows the iterator to recursively visit all data members of the specified type at all levels of nesting.

More specifically, each object included in the iteration, as well as the initial argument to ***Begin()***, must have a statically implemented [GetTypeInfo()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=GetTypeInfo) class member function to provide the needed type information. For example, all of the serializable objects generated by [datatool](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) in the `src/objects` subtrees have ***GetTypeInfo()*** member functions. In order to apply type iterators to user-defined classes (as in the above example), these classes must also make their type information explicit. A set of macros is provided to simplify the implementation of the ***GetTypeInfo()*** methods for user-defined classes. The example included at the end of this section (see [Additional Information](#ch_ser.iterators.html_appendix)) uses several of the C++ Toolkit type iterators and demonstrates how to apply some of these macros.

The ***CTypeConstIterator*** parallels the ***CTypeIterator***, and is intended for use with `const` objects (i.e. when you want to prohibit modifications to the objects you are iterating over). For `const` iterators, the ***ConstBegin()*** function should be used in place of ***Begin()***.

<a name="ch_ser.iterators.html_hier"></a>

### Class hierarchies, embedded objects, and the NCBI C++ type iterators

As emphasized above, all of the objects visited by an iterator must have the ***GetTypeInfo()*** member function defined in order for the iterators to work properly. For an iterator that visits objects of type ***T***, the type information provided by ***GetTypeInfo()*** is used to identify:

-   data members of type ***T***

-   data members containing objects of type ***T***

-   data members derived from type ***T***

-   data members containing objects derived from type ***T***

Explicit encoding of the class hierarchy via the ***GetTypeInfo()*** methods allows the user to deploy a type iterator over a single specified type which may in practice include a set of types via inheritance. The section [Additional Information](#ch_ser.iterators.html_appendix) includes a simple example of this feature. A further generalization of this idea is implemented by the [CTypesIterator](#ch_ser.iterators.html_typesIt) described later.

<a name="ch_ser.iterators.html_cobjType"></a>

### ***CObjectIterator*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/serial/iterator.hpp)) and ***CObjectConstIterator*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/serial/iterator.hpp))

Because the ***CObject*** class is so central to the Toolkit, a special iterator is also defined, which can automatically distinguish ***CObject***s from other class types. The syntax of a ***CObjectIterator*** is:

    for (CObjectIterator i(Begin(ObjectName)); i; ++i)

Note that there is no need to specify the object type to iterate over, as the type ***CObject*** is built into the iterator itself. This iterator will recursively visit all ***CObject***s contained or referenced in **`ObjectName`**. The ***CObjectConstIterator*** is identical to the ***CObjectIterator*** but is designed to operate on `const` elements and uses the ***ConstBegin()*** function.

User-defined classes that are derived from ***CObject*** can also be iterated over (assuming their ***GetTypeInfo()*** methods have been implemented). In general however, care should be used in applying this type of iterator, as not all of the NCBI C++ Toolkit classes derived from ***CObject*** have implementations of the ***GetTypeInfo()*** method. **All** of the generated serializable objects in `include/objects` **do** have a defined ***GetTypeInfo()*** member function however, and thus can be iterated over using either a ***CObjectIterator*** or a ***CTypeIterator*** with an appropriate template argument.

<a name="ch_ser.iterators.html_stdType"></a>

### ***CStdTypeIterator*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCStdTypeIterator.html)) and ***CStdTypeConstIterator*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCStdTypeConstIterator.html))

All of the type iterators described thus far require that each object visited must provide its own type information. Hence, none of these can be applied to standard types such as ***int, float, double*** or the STL type ***string***. The ***CStdTypeIterator*** and ***CStdTypeConstIterator*** classes selectively iterate over data members of a specified type. But for these iterators, the type **must** be a simple C type (***int, double, char\*, etc.***) or an STL type ***string***. For example, to iterate over all the ***string*** data members in a ***CPerson*** object, we could use:

    for (CStdTypeIterator<string> i(Begin(neighborhood)); i; ++i) {
        cout << *i << ' ';
    }

The ***CStdTypeConstIterator*** is identical to the ***CStdTypeIterator*** but is designed to operate on `const` elements and requires the ***ConstBegin()*** function.

For examples using ***CTypeIterator*** and ***CStdTypeIterator***, see [Code Sample 2 (ctypeiter.cpp)](#ch_ser.ctypeiter_cpp.html) and [Code Sample 3 (ctypeiter.hpp)](#ch_ser.ctypeiter_hpp.html).

### ***CTypesIterator*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CTypesIterator))

Sometimes it is necessary to iterate over a set of types contained inside an object. The ***CTypesIterator***, as its name suggests, is designed for this purpose. For example, suppose you have loaded a gene sequence into memory as a ***CBioseq*** (named **`seq`**), and want to iterate over all of its references to genes and organisms. The following sequence of statements defines an iterator that will step through all of **`seq`**'s data members (recursively), stopping only at references to gene and organism citations:

    CTypesIterator i;
    CType<CGene_ref>::AddTo(i);    // define the types to stop at
    CType<COrg_ref>::AddTo(i);

    for (i = Begin(seq); i; ++i) {

        if (CType<CGene_ref>::Match(i)) {
            CGene_ref* geneRef = CType<CGene_ref>::Get(i);
            ...
        }
        else if (CType<COrg_ref>::Match(i) {
            COrg_ref* orgRef = CType<COrg_ref>::Get(i);
            ...
        }
    }

Here, [CType](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCType.html) is a helper template class that simplifies the syntax required to use the multiple types iterator:

-   `CType<TypeName>::AddTo(i)` specifies that iterator **`i`** should stop at type ***TypeName***.

-   `CType<TypeName>::Match(i)` returns `true` if the specified type ***TypeName*** is the type currently pointed to by iterator **`i`**.

-   `CType<TypeName>::Get(i)` retrieves the object currently pointed to by iterator **`i`if** there is a type match to ***TypeName***, and otherwise returns 0. In the event there is a type match, the retrieved object is type cast to ***TypeName*** before it is returned.

The ***Begin()*** expression is as described for the above ***CTypeIterator*** and ***CTypeConstIterator*** classes. The [CTypesConstIterator](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CTypesConstIterator) is the `const` implementation of this type of iterator, and requires the ***ConstBegin()*** function.

<a name="ch_ser.iterators.context_filter"></a>

### Context Filtering In Type Iterators

In addition to traversing objects of a specific type one might want to specify the structural context in which such objects should appear. For example, you might want to iterate over ***string*** data members, but only those called `title`. This could be done using context filtering. Such a filter is a string with the format identical to the one used in [Stack Path Hooks](#ch_ser.stack_path_hooks) and is specified as an additional parameter of a type iterator. So, for example, the declaration of a string data member iterator with context filtering could look like this:

    CStdTypeIterator<string> i(Begin(my_obj), "*.title")

<a name="ch_ser.iterators.html_appendix"></a>

### Additional Information

The following example demonstrates how the class hierarchy determines which data members will be included in a type iterator. The example uses five simple classes:

-   Class ***CA*** contains a single ***int*** data member and is used as a target object type for the type iterators demonstrated.

-   class ***CB*** contains an ***auto\_ptr*** to a ***CA*** object.

-   Class ***CC*** is derived from ***CA*** and is used to demonstrate the usage of class hierarchy information.

-   Class ***CD*** contains an ***auto\_ptr*** to a ***CC*** object, and, since it is derived from ***CObject***, can be used as the object pointed to by a [CRef](ch_core.html#ch_core.smart_ptrs).

-   Class ***CX*** contains both pointers-to and instances-of ***CA, CB, CC***, and ***CD*** objects, and is used as the argument to ***Begin()*** for the demonstrated type iterators.

The preprocessor macros used in this example implement the ***GetTypeInfo()*** methods for the classes.

    // Define a simple class to use as iterator's target objects
    class CA
    {
    public:
        CA() : m_Data(0) {};
        CA(int n) : m_Data(n) {};
        static const CTypeInfo* GetTypeInfo(void);
        int m_Data;
    };
    // Define a class containing an auto_ptr to the target class
    class CB
    {

Runtime Object Type Information
-------------------------------

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Type and Object specific info](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_ctypeinfo_ref)

-   [Object Information Classes](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_cobjinfo)

-   [CObjectTypeInfo (\*)](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objtype)

-   [CConstObjectInfo (\*)](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_constobj)

-   [CObjectInfo (\*)](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objinfo)

-   [CEnumeratedTypeValues](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_enumval)


<a name="ch_ser.typeinfo.html_ctypeinfo_ref"></a>

### Type and Object specific info

Run-time information about data types is necessary in several contexts, including:

1.  When reading, writing, and processing serialized data, where runtime information about a type's internal structure is needed.

2.  When reading from an arbitrary data source, where data members' external aliases must be used to locate the corresponding class data members (e.g.*MyXxx* may be aliased as *my-xxx* in the input data file).

3.  When using a generalized [C++ type iterator](#ch_ser.iterators.html) to traverse the data members of an object.

4.  When accessing the object type information *per se* (without regard to any particular object instance), e.g. to dump it to a file as ASN.1 or DTD specifications (not data).

In the first three cases above, it is necessary to have both the object itself as well as its runtime type information. This is because in these contexts, the object is usually passed inside a generic function, as a pointer to its most base parent type [CObject.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObject.html) The runtime type information is needed here, as there is no other way to ascertain the actual object's data members. In addition to providing this information, a runtime type information object provides an interface for accessing and modifying these data members.

In case (4) above, the type information is used independent of any actual object instances.

The NCBI C++ Toolkit uses two classes to support these requirements:

-   **Type information classes** (base class [CTypeInfo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCTypeInfo.html)) are intended for internal usage only, and they encode information about a type, devoid of any instances of that type. This information includes the class layout, inheritance relations, external alias, and various other attributes such as size, which are independent of specific instances. Each data member of a class also has its own type information. Thus, in addition to providing information relevant to the member's occurrence in the class (e.g. the member name and offset), the type information for a `class` must also provide access to the type information for each of its `members`. Enumerations are a special kind of primitive type, whose type information specifies its enumeration values and named elements. Type information for containers specifies both the type of container and the type of elements that it holds.

-   [Object information classes](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_cobjinfo) (base class [CObjectTypeInfo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectTypeInfo.html)) include a pointer to the type information as well as a pointer to the object ***instance***, and provide a safe interface to that object. In situations where type information is used independent of any concrete object, the object information class simply serves as a wrapper to a type information object. Where access to an object instance is required, the object pointer provides direct access to the correctly type-cast instance, and the interface provides methods to access and/or modify the object itself or members of that object.

The C++ Toolkit stores the type information outside any instances of that type, in a statically created ***CTypeInfo*** object. For class objects, this ***CTypeInfo*** object can be accessed by all instances of the class via a static [GetTypeInfo()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=GetTypeInfo) class method. 

All of the automatically generated classes and constructs defined in the C++ Toolkit's [objects/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects) directory already have static ***GetTypeInfo()*** functions implemented for them. In order to make type information about `user-defined` classes and elements also accessible, you will need to implement static ***GetTypeInfo()*** functions for these constructs.

Type information is often needed when the object itself has been passed anonymously, or as a pointer to its parent class. In this case, it is not possible to invoke the ***GetTypeInfo()*** method directly, as the object's exact type is unknown. Using a `<static_cast>` operator to enable the member function is also unsafe, as it may open the door to incorrectly associating an object's pointer with the wrong type information. For these reasons, the ***CTypeInfo*** class is intended for internal usage only, and it is the [CObjectTypeInfo](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_cobjinfo) classes that provide a more safe and friendly user interface to type information.

### Object Information Classes

The following topics are discussed in this section:

#### ***CObjectTypeInfo*** ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectTypeInfo.html))

This is the base class for all `object` information classes. It is intended for usage where there is no concrete object being referenced, and all that is required is access to the type information. A ***CObjectTypeInfo*** contains a pointer to a low-level ***CTypeInfo*** object, and functions as a user-friendly wrapper class.

The constructor for ***CObjectTypeInfo*** takes a pointer to a `const CTypeInfo` object as its single argument. This is precisely what is returned by all of the static ***GetTypeInfo()*** functions. Thus, to create a ***CObjectTypeInfo*** for the ***CBioseq*** class - without reference to any particular instance of ***CBioseq*** - one might use:

`CObjectTypeInfo objInfo( CBioseq::GetTypeInfo() );`

One of the most important methods provided by the ***CObjectTypeInfo*** class interface is ***GetTypeFamily()***, which returns an enumerated value indicating the `type family` for the object of interest. Five type families are defined by the [ETypeFamily](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=ETypeFamily) enumeration:

    ETypeFamily GetTypeFamily(void) const;
        enum ETypeFamily {
        eTypeFamilyPrimitive,
        eTypeFamilyClass,
        eTypeFamilyChoice,
        eTypeFamilyContainer,
        eTypeFamilyPointer
    };

Different queries become appropriate depending on the ***ETypeFamily*** of the object. For example, if the object is a container, one might need to determine the type of container (e.g. whether it is a ***list***, ***map*** etc.), and the type of element. Similarly, if an object is a primitive type (e.g. ***int, float, string,*** etc.), an appropriate query becomes what the value type is, and in the case of integer-valued types, whether or not it is signed. Finally, in the case of more complex objects such as class and choice objects, access to the type information for the individual data members and choice variants is needed. The following methods are included in the ***CObjectTypeInfo*** interface for these purposes:

For objects with family type `eTypeFamilyPrimitive`:

    EPrimitiveValueType GetPrimitiveValueType(void) const;
    bool IsPrimitiveValueSigned(void) const;

For objects with family type `eTypeFamilyClass`:

    CMemberIterator BeginMembers(void) const;
    CMemberIterator FindMember(const string& memberName) const;
    CMemberIterator FindMemberByTag(int memberTag) const;

For objects with family type `eTypeFamilyChoice`:

    CVariantIterator BeginVariants(void) const;
    CVariantIterator FindVariant(const string& memberName) const;
    CVariantIterator FindVariantByTag(int memberTag) const;

For objects with family type `eTypeFamilyContainer`:

    EContainerType GetContainerType(void) const;
    CObjectTypeInfo GetElementType(void) const;

For objects with family type `eTypeFamilyPointer`:

    CObjectTypeInfo GetPointedType(void) const;

The two additional enumerations referred to here, [EContainerType](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=EContainerType) and [EPrimitiveValueType](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=EPrimitiveValueType), are defined, along with ***ETypeFamily***, in [include/serial/serialdef.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/serial/serialdef.hpp).

Different iterator classes are used for iterating over class data members versus choice variant types. Thus, if the object of interest is a C++ class object, then access to the type information for its members can be gained using a ***CObjectTypeInfo::CMemberIterator***. The ***BeginMembers()*** method returns a ***CMemberIterator*** pointing to the first data member in the class; the ***FindMember\*()*** methods return a ***CMemberIterator*** pointing to a data member whose name or tag matches the input argument. The ***CMemberIterator*** class is a forward iterator whose operators are defined as follows:

-   the `++` operator increments the iterator (makes it point to the next class member)

-   the `()` operator tests that the iterator has not exceeded the legitimate range

-   the `*` dereferencing operator returns a ***CObjectTypeInfo*** for the data member the iterator currently points to

Similarly, the ***BeginVariants()*** and ***FindVariant()*** methods allow iteration over the choice variant data types for a choice class, and the dereferencing operation yields a ***CObjectTypeInfo*** object for the choice variant currently pointed to by the iterator.

<a name="ch_ser.typeinfo.html_constobj"></a>

#### CConstObjectInfo ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCConstObjectInfo.html))

The ***CConstObjectInfo*** (derived from [CObjectTypeInfo](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objtype)) adds an interface to access the particular instance of an object (in addition to the interface inherited from [CObjectTypeInfo](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objtype), which provides access to type information only). It is intended for usage with `const` instances of the object of interest, and therefore the interface does not permit any modifications to the object. The constructor for ***CConstObjectInfo*** takes two arguments:

    CConstObjectInfo(const void* instancePtr, const CTypeInfo* typeinfoPtr);

(Alternatively, the constructor can be invoked with a single STL pair containing these two objects.)

Each ***CConstObjectInfo*** contains a pointer to the object's type information as well as a pointer to an instance of the object. The existence or validity of this instance can be checked using any of the following ***CConstObjectInfo*** methods and operators:

-   `bool Valid(void) const;`

-   `operator bool(void) const;`

-   `bool operator!(void) const;`

For `primitive` type objects, the ***CConstObjectInfo*** interface provides access to the currently assigned value using ***GetPrimitiveValueXxx()***. Here, **`Xxx`** may be `Bool, Char, Long, ULong, Double, String, ValueString`, or `OctetString`. In general, to get a primitive value, one first applies a `switch` statement to the value returned by ***GetPrimitiveValueType()***, and then calls the appropriate ***GetPrimitiveValueXxx()*** method depending on the branch followed, e.g.:

    switch ( obj.GetPrimitiveValueType() ) {
    case ePrimitiveValueBool:
        bool b = obj.GetPrimitiveValueBool();
        break;

    case ePrimitiveValueInteger:
        if ( obj.IsPrimitiveValueSigned() ) {
            long l = obj.GetPrimitiveValueLong();
        } else {
            unsigned long ul = obj.GetPrimitiveValueULong();
        }
        break;
        //... etc.
    }

Member iterator methods are also defined in the ***CConstObjectInfo*** class, with a similar interface to that found in the ***CObjectTypeInfo*** class. In this case however, the dereferencing operators return a ***CConstObjectInfo*** object - not a ***CObjectTypeInfo*** object - for the current member. For C++`class` objects, these member functions are:

-   `CMemberIterator BeginMembers(void) const;`

-   `CMemberIterator FindClassMember(const string& memberName) const;`

-   `CMemberIterator FindClassMemberByTag(int memberTag) const;`

For C++ choice objects, only one variant is ever selected, and only that choice variant is instantiated. As it does not make sense to define a `CConstObjectInfo iterator` for uninstantiated variants, the method ***GetCurrentChoiceVariant()*** is provided instead. The dereferencing operator (\*) can be applied to the object returned by this method to obtain a ***CConstObjectInfo*** for the variant. Of course, type information for unselected variants can still be accessed using the ***CObjectTypeInfo*** methods.

The ***CConstObjectInfo*** class also defines an element iterator for container type objects. ***CConstObjectInfo::CElementIterator*** is a forward iterator whose interface includes increment and testing operators. Dereferencing is implemented by the iterator's ***GetElement()*** method, which returns a ***CConstObjectInfo*** for the element currently pointed to by the iterator.

Finally, for pointer type objects, the type returned by the method ***GetPointedObject()*** is also a ***CConstObjectInfo*** for the object - not just a ***CObjectTypeInfo***.

<a name="ch_ser.typeinfo.html_objinfo"></a>

#### CObjectInfo ([\*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectInfo.html))

The ***CObjectInfo*** class is in turn derived from ***CConstObjectInfo***, and is intended for usage with `mutable` instances of the object of interest. In addition to all of the methods inherited from the parent class, the interface to this class also provides methods that allow modification of the object itself or its data members.

For primitive type objects, a set of ***SetPrimitiveValueXxx()*** methods are available, complimentary to the ***GetPrimitiveValueXxx()*** methods described above. Methods that return member iterator objects are again reimplemented, and the de-referencing operators now return a ***CObjectInfo*** object for that data member. As the ***CObjectInfo*** now points to a `mutable` object, these iterators can be used to set values for the data member. Similarly, ***GetCurrentChoiceVariant()*** now returns a ***CObjectInfo***, as does `CObjectInfo::CElementIterator::GetElement()`.

<a name="ch_ser.typeinfo.html_enumval"></a>

#### CEnumeratedTypeValues

Enumerated types (values with name and numeric ID) defined in data specifications translate into sets of `enum` in C++ code. Still, their type information exist and is available for analysis through  [CEnumeratedTypeValues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCEnumeratedTypeValues.html) class. For example, the following ASN.1 definition

    PC-TermType ::= INTEGER {
        sidsynonym (1),
        cidsynonym (2),
        meshheading (3),
        meshdescr (4),
        meshterm (5),
        meshtreenode (6)
    }

results in this C++ code:

    enum EPC_TermType {
        ePC_TermType_sidsynonym   = 1,
        ePC_TermType_cidsynonym   = 2,
        ePC_TermType_meshheading  = 3,
        ePC_TermType_meshdescr    = 4,
        ePC_TermType_meshterm     = 5,
        ePC_TermType_meshtreenode = 6
    };
    /// Access to EPC_TermType's attributes (values, names) as defined in spec
    const NCBI_NS_NCBI::CEnumeratedTypeValues* ENUM_METHOD_NAME(EPC_TermType)(void);

Having pointer to an object of `CEnumeratedTypeValues` class, an application can get detailed information about the enumeration, like string name by numeric ID, for example.

Traversing a Data Structure
---------------------------

The following topics are discussed in this section:

-   [Locating the Class Definitions](#ch_ser.traverse.html_locateClass)

-   [Accessing and Referencing Data Members](#ch_ser.traverse.html_accessMember)

-   [Traversing a Biostruc](#ch_ser.traverse.html_example)

-   [Iterating Over Containers](#ch_ser.traverse.html_iterate)

<a name="ch_ser.traverse.html_locateClass"></a>

### Locating the Class Definitions

In general, traversing through a class object requires that you first become familiar with the internal class structure and member access functions for that object. In this section we consider how you can access this information in the source files, and apply it. The example provided here involves a ***Biostruc*** type which is implemented by class [CBiostruc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc.html), and its base (parent) class, [CBiostruc\_Base.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc__Base.html)

The first question is: how do I locate the class definitions implementing the object to be traversed? There are now two source browsers which you can use. To obtain a synopsis of the class, you can search the [index](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classes.html) or the [class hierarchy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/hierarchy.html) of the *Doc++* browser and follow a link to the class. For example, a synopsis of the [CBiostruc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc.html) class is readily available. From this page, you can also access the relevant source files archived by the*LXR* browser, by following the [Locate CBiostruc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CBiostruc) link. Alternatively, you may want to access the *LXR* engine directly by using the [Identifier search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CBiostruc) tool.

Because we wish to determine which headers to include, the synopsis displayed by the [Identifier search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CBiostruc) tool is most useful. There we find a single header file, [Biostruc.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects/mmdb1/Biostruc.hpp), listed as defining the class. Accordingly, this is the header file we must include. The ***CBiostruc*** class inherits from the ***CBiostruc\_Base*** class however, and we will need to consult that file as well to understand the internal structure of the ***CBiostruc*** class. Following a link to the parent class from the class hierarchy browser, we find the definition of the [CBiostruc\_Base](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc__Base.html) class.

This is where we must look for the definitions and access functions we will be using. However, it is the `derived user class` (***CBiostruc***) whose header should be included in your source files, and which should be instantiated by your local program variable. For a more general discussion of the relationship between the base parent objects and their derived user classes, see [Working with the serializable object classes.](ch_proj.html#ch_proj.base_classes)

<a name="ch_ser.traverse.html_accessMember"></a>

### Accessing and Referencing Data Members

Omitting some of the low-level details of the base class, we find the ***CBiostruc\_Base*** class has essentially the following structure:

    class CBiostruc_Base : public CObject
    {
    public:
        // type definitions
        typedef list< CRef<CBiostruc_id> > TId;
        typedef list< CRef<CBiostruc_descr> > TDescr;
        typedef list< CRef<CBiostruc_feature_set> > TFeatures;
        typedef list< CRef<CBiostruc_model> > TModel;
        typedef CBiostruc_graph TChemical_graph;
        // Get() members
        const TId& GetId(void) const;
        const TDescr& GetDescr(void) const;
        const TChemical_graph& GetChemical_graph(void) const;
        const TFeatures& GetFeatures(void) const;
        const TModel& GetModel(void) const;
        // Set() members
        TId& SetId(void);
        TDescr& SetDescr(void);
        TChemical_graph& SetChemical_graph(void);
        TFeatures& SetFeatures(void);
        TModel& SetModel(void);
    private:
        TId m_Id;
        TDescr m_Descr;
        TChemical_graph m_Chemical_graph;
        TFeatures m_Features;
        TModel m_Model;
    };

With the exception of the structure's chemical graph, each of the class's private data members is actually a ***list*** of references (pointers), as specified by the type definitions. For example, ***TId*** is a list of [CRef](ch_core.html#ch_core.CRef) objects, where each ***CRef*** object points to a [CBiostruc\_id](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc__id.html). The ***CRef*** class is a type of smart pointer used to hold a pointer to a reference-counted object. The dereferencing operator, when applied to a (dereferenced) iterator pointing to an element of ***CBiostruc::TId***, e.g. `**CRef_i`, will return a ***CBiostruc\_id***. Thus, the call to ***GetId()*** returns a list which must then be iterated over and dereferenced to get the individual ***CBiostruc\_id*** objects. In contrast, the function ***GetChemicalGraph()*** returns the object directly, as it does not involve a ***list*** or a ***CRef***.

NOTE: It is strongly recommended that you use type names defined in the generated classes (e.g. ***TId***, ***TDescr***) rather than generic container names (***list\< CRef\<CBiostruc\_id\> \>*** etc.). The real container class may change occasionally and you will have to modify the code using generic container types every time it happens. When iterating over a container it's recommended to use **`ITERATE`** and **`NON_CONST_ITERATE`** macros.

The ***GetXxx()*** and ***SetXxx()*** member functions define the user interface to the class, providing methods to access and modify ("mutate") private data. In addition, most classes, including ***CBiostruc***, have ***IsSetXxx()*** and ***ResetXxx()*** methods to validate and clear the data members, respectively.

### Traversing a Biostruc

The program `traverseBS.cpp` (see [Code Sample 4](#ch_ser.traverse_cpp.html)) demonstrates how one might load a serial data file and iterate over the components of the resulting object. This example reads from a text ASN.1 Biostruc file and stores the information into a ***CBiostruc*** object in memory. The overloaded ***Visit()*** function is then used to recursively examine the object `CBiostruc bs` and its components.

        SetDiagStream(&diag);

        CTestAsn theTestApp;
        return theTestApp.AppMain(argc, argv);
    }

`Visit(bs)` simply calls ***Visit()*** on each of the ***CBiostruc*** data members, which are accessed using `bs.GetXxx()`. The information needed to write each of these functions - the data member types and member function signatures - is contained in the respective header files. For example, looking at [Biostruc\_.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects/mmdb1/Biostruc_.hpp), we learn that the structure's descriptor list can be accessed using ***GetDescr()***, and that the type returned is a list of pointers to descriptors:

    typedef list< CRef<CBiostruc_descr> > TDescr;
    const TDescr& GetDescr(void) const;

Consulting the base class for [CBiostruc\_desc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CBiostruc_descr_Base) in turn, we learn that this class has a `choice state` defining the type of value stored there as well as the method that should be used to access that value. This leads to an implementation of [Visit(CBiostruc::TDescr DescrList)](#ch_ser.traverse_cpp.html) that uses an iterator over its list argument and a switch statement over the current descriptor's choice state.

<a name="ch_ser.traverse.html_iterate"></a>

### Iterating Over Containers

Most of the ***Visit()*** functions implemented here rely on standard STL iterators to walk through a list of objects. The general syntax for using an iterator is:

    ContainerType ContainerName;
    ITERATE(ContainerType, it, ContainerName) {
        ObjectType ObjectName = *it;
        // ...
    }

Dereferencing the iterator is required, as the iterator behaves like a pointer that traverses consecutive elements of the container. For example, to iterate over the list of descriptors in the *Biostruc*, we use a container of type ***CBiostruc::TDescr***, and the constant version of the **`ITERATE`** macro to ensure that the data is not mutated in the body of the loop. Because the descriptor list contains pointers ([CRefs](ch_core.html#ch_core.CRef)) to objects, we will actually need to dereference **twice** to get to the objects themselves.

    ITERATE(CBiostruc::TDescr, it, descList) {
        const CBiostruc_descr& thisDescr = **it;
        // ...
    }

In traversing the descriptor list in this example, we handled each type of descriptor with an explicit `case` statement. In fact, however, we really only visit those descriptors whose types have string representations: ***TName, TPdb\_comment***, and ***TOther\_comment***. The other two descriptor types, ***THistory*** and ***TAttribute***, are objects that are "visited" recursively, but the associated visit functions are not actually implemented (see [Code Sample 5](#ch_ser.traverse_hpp.html), `traverseBS.hpp`).

<a name="ch_ser.traverse_hpp.html"></a>

#### Code Sample 5. traverseBS.hpp

    // File name traverseBS.hpp

    #ifndef NCBI_TRAVERSEBS__HPP
    #define NCBI_TRAVERSEBS__HPP

    #include <corelib/ncbistd.hpp>
    #include <corelib/ncbiapp.hpp>

    USING_NCBI_SCOPE;
    using namespace objects;

    // class CTestAsn
    class CTestAsn : public CNcbiApplication {
    public:
        virtual int Run ();
    };

    void Visit(const CBiostruc&);
    void Visit(const CBiostruc::TId&);
    void Visit(const CBiostruc::TDescr&);
    void Visit(const CBiostruc::TChemical_graph&);
    void Visit(const CBiostruc::TFeatures&);
    void Visit(const CBiostruc::TModel&);
    void Visit(const CBiostruc_history&) {
        cout << "visiting history" << endl;
    };

    // Not implemented
    void Visit(const CBiostruc_descr::TAttribution&) {};
    void VisitWithIterator (const CBiostruc::TDescr& descList);

    #endif /* NCBI_TRAVERSEBS__HPP */

The NCBI C++ Toolkit provides a rich and powerful [set of iterators](#ch_ser.iterators.html) for various application needs. An alternative to using the above `switch` statement to visit elements of the descriptor list would have been to use an NCBI [CStdTypeIterator](#ch_ser.iterators.html_stdType) that only visits strings. For example, we could implement the Visit function on a ***CBiostruc::TDescr*** as follows:

    void Visit(const CBiostruc::TDescr& descList)
    {
        ITERATE(CBiostruc::TDescr, it1, descList) {
            for (CStdTypeConstIterator<string> it2(ConstBegin(**it1));  it2;  ++it2) {
                cout << *it2 << endl;
            }
        }
    }

In this example, the iterator will skip over all but the string data members.

The ***CStdTypeIterator*** is one of several iterators which makes use of an object's `type information` to implement the desired functionality. We began this section by positing that the traversal of an object requires an a priori knowledge of that object's internal structure. This is not strictly true however, if type information for the object is also available. An object's type information specifies the class layout, inheritance relations, data member names, and various other attributes such as size, which are independent of specific instances. All of the C++ type iterators described in [The NCBI C++ Toolkit Iterators](#ch_ser.iterators.html) section utilize type information, which is the topic of a previous section: [Runtime Object Type Information](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html).

SOAP support
------------

The NCBI C++ Toolkit SOAP server and client provide a limited level of support of SOAP 1.1 over HTTP, and use the document binding style with a literal schema definition. Document/literal is the style that most Web services platforms were focusing on when this feature was introduced. [DATATOOL](#ch_ser.Generating_a_SOAP_client_using_DA) application can be used to parse WSDL (Web services description language) specification and create SOAP client.

<a name="ch_ser.SOAP_message"></a>

### SOAP message

The core section of the SOAP specification is the messaging framework. The client sends a request and receives a response in the form of a SOAP message. A SOAP message is a one-way transmission between SOAP nodes: from a SOAP sender to a SOAP receiver. The root element of a SOAP message is the `Envelope`. The `Envelope` contains an optional `Header` element followed by a mandatory `Body` element. The `Body` element represents the message payload - it is a generic container that can contain any number of elements from any namespace.

In the Toolkit, the [CSoapMessage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/search?string=CSoapMessage) class defines `Header` and `Body` containers. Serializable objects (derived from the [CSerialObject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CSerialObject) class) can be added into these containers using ***AddObject()*** method. Such a message object can then be sent to a message receiver. The response will also come in the form of an object derived from [CSoapMessage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/search?string=CSoapMessage). At this time, it is possible to investigate its contents using ***GetContent()*** method; or ask directly for an object of a specific type using the [SOAP\_GetKnownObject()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/search?string=SOAP_GetKnownObject) template function.

<a name="ch_ser.SOAP_client_CSoapHtt"></a>

### SOAP client ([CSoapHttpClient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CSoapHttpClient))

The SOAP client is the initial SOAP sender - a node that originates a SOAP message. Knowing the SOAP receiver's URL, it sends a SOAP request and receives a response using the ***Invoke()*** method.

Internally, data objects in the Toolkit SOAP library are serialized and de-serialized using serializable objects streams. Since each serial data object also provides access to its type information, writing such objects is a straightforward operation. Reading the response is not that transparent. Before actually parsing incoming data, the SOAP processor should decide which object type information to use. Hence, a client application should tell the SOAP processor what types of data objects it might encounter in the incoming data. If the processor recognizes the object's type, it will parse the incoming data and store it as an instance of the recognized type. Otherwise, the processor will parse the data into an instance of the [CAnyContentObject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CAnyContentObject) class.

So, a SOAP client must:

-   Define the server's URL.

-   Register the object types that might be present in the incoming data (using the ***RegisterObjectType()*** method).

The [CSoapHttpClient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CSoapHttpClient) class also has methods for getting and setting the server URL and the default namespace.

<a name="ch_ser.SOAP_server_CSoapSer"></a>

### SOAP server ([CSoapServerApplication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CSoapServerApplication))

The SOAP server receives SOAP mesages from a client and processes the contents of the SOAP Body and SOAP Header.

The processing of incoming requests is done with the help of "message listeners" - the server methods which analyze requests (in the form of objects derived from [CSoapMessage](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/search?string=CSoapMessage)) and create responses. It is possible to have more than one listener for each message. When such a listener returns TRUE, the SOAP server base class object passes the request to the next listener, if it exists, and so on.

The server can return a WSDL specification if the specification file name is passed to the server's constructor and the file is located with the server.

<a name="ch_ser.Generating_a_SOAP_client_using_DA"></a>

### Generating a SOAP client using DATATOOL

DATATOOL can be used to conveniently create SOAP client source code, for example:

    datatool -m soap_server_sample.wsdl -oA -oc sample -oph sample  -opc sample -orq

The following topics in the [DATATOOL documentation](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) contain additional details:

-   [Code generation arguments](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool.html_refCodeGenerationAr)

-   [Generated code](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool.html_refCode)

<a name="ch_ser.Sample_SOAP_server_a"></a>

### Sample SOAP server and client

The Toolkit contains a simple example of SOAP client and server in its `src/sample/app/soap` folder.

The sample SOAP server supports the following operations:

***GetDescription()*** - server receives an empty object of type Description, and it sends back a single string;

***GetVersion()*** - server receives a string, and it sends back two integer numbers and a string;

***DoMath()*** - server receives a list of Operand objects (two integers and an enumerated value), and it sends back a list of integers

The starting point is the WSDL specification - `src\sample\app\soap\server\soap_server_sample.wsdl`

Both client and server use data objects whose types are described in the message types section of WSDL specification. So, we extract the XML schema part of the specification into a separate file, and create a static library - `soap_dataobj`. All code in this library is generated automatically by .

<a name="ch_ser.Sample_server"></a>

#### Sample server

Server is a CGI application. In its constructor we define the name of WSDL specification file and the default namespace for the data objects. Since server's ability to return a WSDL specification upon request from a client is optional, it is possible to give an empty file name here. Once the name is not empty, the WSDL file should be deployed alongside the server.

During initialization server should register incoming object types and message listeners:

`// Register incoming object types, so the SOAP message parser can`

`// recognize these objects in incoming data and parse them correctly.`

`RegisterObjectType(CVersion::GetTypeInfo);`

`RegisterObjectType(CMath::GetTypeInfo);`

`// Register SOAP message processors.`

`// It is possible to set more than one listeners for a particular message;`

`// such listeners will be called in the order of registration.`

`AddMessageListener((TWebMethod)(&CSampleSoapServerApplication::GetDescription), "Description");    AddMessageListener((TWebMethod)(&CSampleSoapServerApplication::GetDescription2), "Description");`

`AddMessageListener((TWebMethod)(&CSampleSoapServerApplication::GetVersion), "Version");`

`AddMessageListener((TWebMethod)(&CSampleSoapServerApplication::DoMath), "Math");`

Note that while it is possible to register the `Description` type, it does not make much sense: the object has no content, so there is no difference whether it will be parsed correctly or not.

Message listeners are user-defined functions that process incoming messages. They analyze the content of SOAP message request and populate the response object.

<a name="ch_ser.Sample_client"></a>

#### Sample client

Unlike SOAP server, SOAP client object has nothing to do with [CCgiApplication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/search?string=CCgiApplication) class. It is "just" an object. As such, it can be created and destroyed when appropriate. Sample SOAP client constructor defines the server URL and the default namespace for the data objects. Its constructor is the proper place to register incoming object types:

`// Register incoming object types, so the SOAP message parser can`

`// recognize these objects in incoming data and parse them correctly.`

`RegisterObjectType(CDescriptionText::GetTypeInfo);`

`RegisterObjectType(CVersionResponse::GetTypeInfo);`

`RegisterObjectType(CMathResponse::GetTypeInfo);`

Other methods encapsulate operations supported by the SOAP server, which the client talks to. Common schema is to create two SOAP message object - request and response, populate request object, call ***Invoke()*** method of the base class, and extract the meaningful data from the response.

Processing Serial Data
----------------------

Although this discussion focuses on ASN.1 and XML formatted data, the data structures and tools described here have been designed to (potentially) support any formalized serial data specification. Many of the tools and objects have open-ended abstract or template implementations that can be instantiated differently to fit various specifications.

The following topics are discussed in this section

-   [Accessing the object header files and serialization libraries](#ch_ser.asn.html_headersandlibs)

-   [Reading and writing serial data](#ch_ser.asn.html_example1)

-   [Determining Which Header Files to Include](#ch_ser.asn.html_includes)

-   [Determining Which Libraries to Link To](#ch_ser.asn.html_linklibs)

<a name="ch_ser.asn.html_headersandlibs"></a>

### Accessing the object header files and serialization libraries

Reading and writing serialized data is implemented by an integrated set of streams, filters, and object types. An application that reads encoded data files will require the object header files and libraries which define how these serial streams of data should be loaded into memory. This entails `#include` statements in your source files, as well as the associated library specifications in your makefiles. The object header and implementation files are located in the [include/objects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects) and [src/objects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects) subtrees of the C++ tree, respectively. The header and implementation files for serialized streams and type information are in the [include/serial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/serial) and [src/serial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/serial) directories.

If you have checked out the `objects` directories, but not explicitly run the [datatool](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) code generator, then you will find that your `include/objects` subdirectories are (almost) empty, and the source subdirectories contain only makefiles and ASN.1 specifications. These makefiles and ASN.1 specifications can be used to build your own copies of the objects' header and implementation files, using `make all_r` (if you configured using the `--with-objects` flag), or running datatool explicitly.

However, building your own local copies of these header and implementation files is neither necessary nor recommended, as it is simpler to use the pre-generated header files and prebuilt libraries. The pre-built header and implementation files can be found in `$NCBI/c++/include/objects/` and `$NCBI/c++/src/objects/`, respectively. Assuming your makefile defines an include path to `$NCBI/c++/include`, selected object header files such as [Date.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects/general/Date.hpp), can be included as:

    #include <objects/general/Date.hpp>

This header file (along with its implementations in the accompanying `src` directory) was generated by [datatool](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) using the specifications from [src/objects/general/general.asn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects/general/general.asn). In order to use the classes defined in the `objects` directories, your source code should begin with the statements:

    USING_NCBI_SCOPE;
    using namespace objects;

All of the objects' header and implementation files are generated by **datatool**, as specified in the ASN.1 specification files. The resulting object definitions however, are not in any way dependent on ASN.1 format, as they simply specify the in-memory representation of the defined data types. Accordingly, the objects themselves can be used to read, interpret, and write any type of serialized data. Format specializations on the input stream are implemented via [CObjectIStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStream.html) objects, which extract the required tags and values from the input data according to the format specified. Similarly, Format specializations on an output stream are implemented via [CObjectOStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStream.html) objects.

<a name="ch_ser.asn.html_example1"></a>

### Reading and writing serial data

Let's consider a program [xml2asn.cpp](#ch_ser.xml2asn_cpp.html) that translates an XML data file containing an object of type [Biostruc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects/mmdb1/mmdb1.asn), to ASN.1 text and binary formats. In ***main()***, we begin by initializing the diagnostic stream to write errors to a local file called `xml2asn.log`. (Exception handling, program tracing, and error logging are described in the [Diagnostic Streams](ch_core.html#ch_core.diag) section).

An instance of the ***CTestAsn*** class is then created, and its member function ***AppMain()*** is invoked. This function in turn calls ***CTestAsn::Run()***. The first three lines of code there define the XML input and ASN.1 output streams, using [auto\_ptr](ch_core.html#ch_core.smart_ptrs), to ensure automatic destruction of these objects.

Each stream is associated with data serialization mechanisms appropriate to the [ESerialDataFormat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=ESerialDataFormat) provided to the constructor:

    enum ESerialDataFormat {
        eSerial_None      = 0,
        eSerial_AsnText   = 1,   /// ASN.1 text
        eSerial_AsnBinary = 2,   /// ASN.1 binary
        eSerial_Xml       = 3,   /// XML
        eSerial_Json      = 4    /// JSON
    };

***CObjectIStream*** and ***CObjectOStream*** are base classes which provide generic interfaces between the specific type information of a serializable object and an I/O stream. The object stream classes that will actually be instantiated by this application, [CObjectIStreamXml](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStreamXml.html), [CObjectOStreamAsn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStreamAsn.html), and [CObjectOStreamAsnBinary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectOStreamAsnBinary.html), are descendants of these base classes.

Finally, a variable for the object type that will be generated from the input stream (in this case a [CBiostruc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc.html)) is defined, and the ***CObject[I/O]Stream*** operators "\<\<" and "\>\>" are used to read and write the serialized data to and from the object. (Note that it is **not** possible to simply "pass the data through", from the input stream to the output stream, using a construct like: `*inObject >> *outObject`). The ***CObject[I/O]Stream***s know nothing about the structure of the specific object - they have knowledge only of the serialization format (text ASN, binary ASN, XML, etc.). In contrast, the [CBiostruc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc.html) knows nothing about I/O and serialization formats, but it contains explicit type information about itself. Thus, the ***CObject[I/O]Stream***s can apply their specialized serialization methods to the data members of ***CBiostruc*** using the [type information](#ch_ser.typeinfo.html_ctypeinfo_ref) associated with that object's class.

<a name="ch_ser.asn.html_includes"></a>

### Determining Which Header Files to Include

As always, we include the `corelib` header files, `ncbistd.hpp` and `ncbiapp.hpp`. In addition, the `serial` header files that define the generic ***CObject[IO]Stream*** objects are included, along with `serial.hpp`, which defines generalized serialization mechanisms including the insertion (`<<`) and extraction (`>>`) operators. Finally, we need to include the header file for the object type we will be using.

There are two source browsers that can be used to locate the appropriate header file for a particular object type. Object class names in the NCBI C++ Toolkit begin with the letter "C". Using the [class hierarchy browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/hierarchy.html), we find ***CBiostruc***, derived from ***CBiostruc\_Base***, which is in turn derived from ***CObject***. Following the `CBiostruc` link, we can then use the `locate` button to move to the LXR source code navigator, and there, find the name of the header file. In this case, we find [CBiostruc.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects/mmdb1/Biostruc.hpp) is located in `include/objects/mmdb1`. Alternatively, if we know the name of the C++ class, the source code navigator's [identifier search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident) tool can be used directly. In summary, the following `#include` statements appear at the top of [xml2asn.cpp](#ch_ser.xml2asn_cpp.html):

    #include <corelib/ncbiapp.hpp>
    #include <serial/serial.hpp>
    #include <serial/objistr.hpp>
    #include <serial/objostr.hpp>
    #include <objects/mmdb1/Biostruc.hpp>

### Determining Which Libraries to Link To

Determining which libraries must be linked to requires a bit more work and may involve some trial and error. The list of available libraries currently includes:

**`access biblio cdd featdef general medlars medline mmdb1 mmdb2 mmdb3 ncbimime objprt proj pub pubmed seq seqalign seqblock seqcode seqfeat seqloc seqres seqset submit xcgi xconnect xfcgi xhtml xncbi xser`**

It should be clear that we will need to link to the core library, `xncbi`, as well as to the serial library, `xser`. In addition, we will need to link to whatever object libraries are entailed by using a [CBiostruc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBiostruc.html) object. Minimally, one would expect to link to the `mmdb` libraries. This in itself is insufficient however, as the ***CBiostruc*** class embeds other types of objects, including PubMed citations, features, and sequences, which in turn embed additional objects such as [Date](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCDate.html). The makefile for `xml2asn.cpp`, `Makefile.xml2asn.app` lists the libraries required for linking in the make variable **`LIB`**.

See also the example program, [asn2asn.cpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/app/asn2asn/asn2asn.cpp) which demonstrates more generalized translation of ***Seq-entry*** and ***Bioseq-set*** (defined in [seqset.asn](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects/seqset/seqset.asn)).

***Note:*** Two online tools are available to help determine which libraries to link with. See the [FAQ](ch_faq.html#ch_faq.faq.CannotFindObjectSymbol) for details.

Managing ASN.1 Specification Versions
-------------------------------------

Occasionally it is necessary to change an ASN.1 specification. However, if not designed properly, a new version of an ASN.1 specification can create incompatibilities between old data files and new software or old software and new data.

<a name="ch_ser.The_cardinal_rule_for_adding_new"></a>

### The cardinal rule for adding new members

The only rule you need to follow to achieve backward compatibility is:

<a name="idp39773808"></a>

> Only add new members to the end of a type, and always make them optional.

***Note:*** In this context, "backward compatibility" means the ability for new readers to read either old or new data.

<a name="ch_ser.Background_for_the_rule_on_adding"></a>

### Background for the rule on adding new members

ASN.1 data writers are generally coded to follow a specific version of the specification, so version-related issues are quite improbable when writing. Data readers are also generally coded according to a given specification version, but the data they read could have been written by any writer version. Thus, problems due to version incompatibilities are most likely to occur when reading.

Text-format ASN.1 data files include member names with the data, so it's easy for the reader to ensure that the read data matches the specification.

Binary data files do not include member names. Instead, they include integer tags which are assumed to correspond to the ASN.1 specification. Therefore, if a new version of a specification inserts a new member between existing members, the tagging will be incompatible with the old version, and data corruption or a crash will result from attempting to read an old data file with a new reader or vice versa.

For example, suppose a specification is changed a la:

<a name="ch_ser.T.nc_old_specificationnew_speci_1"></a>

| Old Specification                                                                                                                                                              | New Specification                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Date ::= SEQUENCE {`<br/>`   year INTEGER ,`<br/>`    month INTEGER ,`<br/>`    day INTEGER }` | `Date ::= SEQUENCE {`<br/>`    year INTEGER ,`<br/>`   epoch VisibleString OPTIONAL ,`<br/>`    month INTEGER ,`<br/>`    day INTEGER }` |

<div class="table-scroll"></div>

The old specification associates tag 2 with month and tag 3 with day; the new specification associates tag 2 with epoch, tag 3 with month, and tag 4 with day. Thus, if an old reader reads a new file it will choke on tag 4 and if a new reader reads an old file it will choke on the absence of tag 4.

However, suppose the specification is changed this way:

<a name="ch_ser.T.nc_old_specificationnew_speci_2"></a>

| Old Specification                                                                                                                                                              | New Specification                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Date ::= SEQUENCE {`<br/>`    year INTEGER ,`<br/>`    month INTEGER ,`<br/>`    day INTEGER }` | `Date ::= SEQUENCE {`<br/>`    year INTEGER ,`<br/>`    month INTEGER ,`<br/>`    day INTEGER ,`<br/>`epoch VisibleString OPTIONAL`<br/>` }` |

<div class="table-scroll"></div>

Now the new reader can read old data without any trouble. Old readers will not be able to read new data because tag 4 was not part of the specification they were built for so they will crash upon the first instance of epoch data (but they will read all data up to that point just fine).

Because of this, it's strongly recommended to add new field(s) as early as possible, preferably long before the new field(s) actually start getting written. This will allow a time for the old readers to get upgraded.

Therefore, the only backward-compatible way of adding new sequence members is to add them at the end, and to make them optional.

<a name="ch_ser.Selfversioning_types"></a>

### Self-versioning types

It is conceivable that a "schema version" could be incorporated into a type beginning with the first version of the type. For example:

<a name="ch_ser.T.nc_subsnp__sequence__version_in"></a>

    subsnp ::= SEQUENCE {
        version INTEGER {
            snp_v1(1),
            snp_v2(2),
            max_version(255) },
        data CHOICE {
            subsnp_v1 SubSNP_v1
            subsnp_v2 SubSNP_v2 }
    }

<div class="table-scroll"></div>

However, old readers would still not be able to read new data. Using `CHOICE` could make sense if there is ever a need to change the specification radically, when adding new fields is not enough. Obviously, the transition from one `CHOICE` variant to another have to be phased in very carefully, allowing significant amount of time for all clients to become aware of the new variant, while still understanding the old one.

What is clear is that this approach could become very cumbersome to maintain if more than a few versions were created.

<a name="ch_ser.Skipping_unknown_data"></a>

### Skipping unknown data

At some point, an old reader may encounter new data, in which case there will be unknown class members and/or choice variants. By default, this condition will cause an exception, but it is possible to skip unknown data using these functions:

-   [CObjectIStream::SetSkipUnknownMembers()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStream.html#a752e6d807cc99bd80279d9833af3ae71)

-   [CObjectIStream::SetSkipUnknownVariants()](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCObjectIStream.html#ac36b639e833b47220261fa559e26eee9)

There are two different methods because one is relatively safe and the other is not.

If you call ***SetSkipUnknownMembers()*** then unknown members will be essentially ignored and the application can process new data in the same way it would process old data.

If you call ***SetSkipUnknownVariants()*** then a lack of coding rigor may cause a problem. Specifically, a choice object won't be set if new data contains an unknown (and therefore skipped) variant. If your code expects the choice object to be set and doesn't verify that it is, then it could cause data corruption and/or crashing.

[Available Serializable Classes](ch_proj.html#ch_proj.ser_object) (as per NCBI ASN.1 Specifications) [Library `xobjects`: [include](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/objects) \| [src](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/objects)]

The ASN.1 data objects are automatically built from their corresponding specifications in the NCBI ASN.1 data model, using [DATATOOL](ch_app.html#ch_app.datatool) to generate all of the required source code. This set of serializable classes defines an interface to many important sequence and sequence-aware objects that users may directly employ, or extend with their own code. An `Object Manager`[(see below)](ch_objmgr.html) coordinates and simplifies the use of these ASN.1-derived objects.
