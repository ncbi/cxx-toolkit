Overview
--------

The overview for this chapter consists of the following topics:

-   Introduction
-   Chapter Outline

### Introduction

To support data compression and decompression the C++ Toolkit have the [Compression API](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/group__Compression.html), a collection of classes that provide uniform way to compress and decompress data in memory, files and standard [streams](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/group__CompressionStreams.html) using different compression algorithms. Such support based on using third party libraries:

-    bzip2 - [http://www.bzip.org/](http://www.bzip.org/)
-    lzo - [http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/)
-    zlib - [http://zlib.org/](http://zlib.org/)

The C++ Toolkit trying to use system version of these libraries installed on host. But, if they are missing, embedded versions of `bzip2` and `zlib` will be automatically used instead. And only `lzo` is supported as a pure 3-rd party package.

Supported compression methods
-----------------------------

The Compression API support next compression methods:
-   [BZIP2](#ch_compress.methods.bzip2)
-   [LZO](#ch_compress.methods.lzo)
-   [ZIP](#ch_compress.methods.zip)
-   [GZIP](#ch_compress.methods.gzip)
-   [ZIP (file format)](#ch_compress.methods.zip.file)
-   [TAR (file format)](#ch_compress.methods.tar.file)

Each compression library have its own set of functions and wrapper classes in the C++ Toolkit, declared in separate headers. Most have a similar structure and methods, allowing easily switch a compression method with a minimal changes in the source code.

<a name="ch_compress.methods.bzip2"></a>
#### BZIP2 [[bzip2.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/bzip2.hpp)]
 
`BZIP2` is known for good compression ratio and slow speed. It compresses data more effectively than `DEFLATE` method, implemented in `zlib` library, but is considerably slower. `BZIP2` performance is asymmetric, and decompression is relatively fast, but still slower than `ZIP`.

<a name="ch_compress.methods.lzo"></a>
#### LZO [[lzo.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/lzo.hpp)]

`lzo` is a data compression library which is suitable for data (de)compression in real-time. This means it favours speed over compression ratio. `LZO` is good to compress some sort of data only, that have a limited set of characters or many recurring sequences. It is not suitable for a random data, that limits its usage. It is better to test this compression on yours own data before making decision to use `LZO` compression method. Use [ZIP](#ch_compress.methods.zip) if you need more universal and robust solution, even it is slower and require more memory.

We don't support all possible compression algorithms, implemented in `lzo` library, only `LZO1X` as most universal, accordingly to author of `lzo` it is often "the best choice of all".
 
`LZO` is a memory block algorithm and is not suitable for stream or file operations from the box, it does not have a corresponding file format as well. So, we use our own wrapper for `LZO` blocks to implement a streams/files support. See [lzo.cpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/util/compress/api/lzo.cpp) for details.
 
<a name="ch_compress.methods.zip"></a>
#### ZIP [[zlib.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/zlib.hpp)]

The `zlib` library uses `DEFLATE` compression algorithm. It is widely used and very universal, providing good compression/decompression ratio and speed for a different range of data. `ZIP` compression method uses regular `zlib` format, which is a wrapper around a deflate stream (RFC 1950). It provides identification and error detection that are not provided by the raw `DEFLATE` algorithm.

<a name="ch_compress.methods.gzip"></a>
#### GZIP [[zlib.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/zlib.hpp)]

This method add support for gzip (.gz) file format. This is version of `ZIP`, but uses special header and footer, that allow to store a file name and other file system information (RFC 1952). It is fully compatible with .gz file format, and allow to store/process concatenated gzip files as well. But, regardless of its relation to files, this format can be used for memory and stream operations as well, if needed.

<a name="ch_compress.methods.zip.file"></a>
#### ZIP (file format) [[archive.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/archive.hpp)]

The Compression API also support `ZIP` file format. `ZIP` is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. A .zip file may contain one or more files or directories that may have been compressed. 

See [Compression archive API](#ch_compress.archiver.arc) for more information.

<a name="ch_compress.methods.tar.file"></a>
#### TAR (file format) [[tar.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/tar.hpp)]

`TAR` is a archive format for collecting many files into one archive file, often referred to as a "tarball", for distribution or backup purposes. The name is derived from *T*ape *AR*(ar)chive, as it was originally developed to write data to sequential I/O devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various file system parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and etc.

See [Tar archive API](#ch_compress.archiver.tar) for more information.


<a name="ch_compress.basic"></a>

Basic methods
-------------

All basic methods for compression/decompression are implemented in the next classes:
-	[CBZip2Compression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBZip2Compression.html)
-	[CLZOCompression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCLZOCompression.html)
-	[CZipCompression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCZipCompression.html)

Each class add support for corresponding compression library (bzip2, lzo, zlib) and have methods to get a version of the used compression library, get or set a compression level, get status of the last operation, error code and description, and declare a specific set of supported compression/decompression flags. Basic compression allows to compress/decompress memory buffer of file with one call to the Compression API.

All archive file formats are supported independently, see [archivers](#ch_compress.archivers) section for more details. 


<a name="ch_compress.memory"></a>

Memory compression and decompression
-----------------------------------

Easiest method to compress/decompress data in memory is to use [***CompressBuffer***](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CompressBuffer) and [***DecompressBuffer***](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=DecompressBuffer) methods. Each compression class, mentioned above, have such methods and allow to use corresponding compression libraries to perform a compression/decompression. Note, that the advantages in simplified usage cost increased memory consumption. You need to know sizes of input and output data in advance, and allocate memory buffers accordingly. If the output buffer is too small, the operation will fail. Some compression methods, like `ZIP` or `LZO`, have [***EstimateCompressionBufferSize***](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=EstimateCompressionBufferSize) method that can help with this. But because it is unknown in advance what kind of data will be compressed, this method behaves a bit pessimistic, and, as a result, an estimated buffer size can be larger than a size of an original non-compressed data.

Below are an examples for in-memory compression and decompression, using `ZIP` method, but you can use any other base class to change it.

Compression:

	CZipCompression c(CCompression::eLevel_Medium);
	bool result = c.CompressBuffer(src_buf, src_len, dst_buf, buf_len, &out_len);
	if (!result) {
	    // error
		// int err_code   = c.GetErrorCode();
        // string err_msg = c.GetErrorDescription();
	}

Decompression:

	CZipCompression c;
	bool result = c.DecompressBuffer(src_buf, src_len, dst_buf, dst_len, &out_len);

In spite of all, these compression/decompression methods are very useful in controlled environment, where sizes of data is well known, providing better compression ratio and speed. For all other cases we recommend to use [compression streams](#ch_compress.streams).


<a name="ch_compress.files"></a>

Files
-------------------------

Similar to memory-based ***CompressBuffer*** and ***DecompressBuffer*** methods, each [mentioned compression class](#ch_compress.basic) have corresponding file-based methods [***CompressFile***](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=CompressFile) and [***DecompressFile***](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=DecompressFile). Both require to specify input and output file names. These classes can be used for some utility operations, when you don`t need additionally process data. Both methods take data from files, compresses or decompresses it, and creates output file on disk as well. 

But sometimes this is not enough. If you need to read some data from a compression file into memory, or write some data from a memory into a file, and compress/decompress it on-the-fly, next classes could be useful:
-	[CBZip2CompressionFile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBZip2CompressionFile.html)
-	[CLZOCompressionFile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCLZOCompressionFile.html)
-	[CZipCompressionFile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCZipCompressionFile.html)

Each class have ***Open***, ***Read***, ***Write*** and ***Close*** methods. That allow to  read/write compressed files, the data will be decompressed or compressed on-the-fly.

Reading data from compressed file (using ***CZipCompression***):

	CZipCompressionFile cf;
	if (!cf.Open(file_path, CCompressionFile::eMode_Read)) {
	    // error
		// int err_code   = cf.GetErrorCode();
        // string err_msg = cf.GetErrorDescription();
	} 
	long n = cf.Read(buf, len);
	if (n < 0) {
	    // error
    }	
	if (n == 0) {
	    // EOF
	}
	// ... other Read() if necessary ...
	cf.Close();

Writing data to file, with compression:

	// Use non-default constructor, that replaces Open() and throws an exception on error
	CZipCompressionFile cf(file_path, CCompressionFile::eMode_Write, CCompression::eLevel_Best);
	long n = cf.Write(buf, len);
	if (n != len) {
	    // error
	}
	// ... other Write() if necessary ...
	cf.Close();
	// Now you have a new .gz compatible file 'file_path'
	
All ***C\*CompressionFile*** classes imply that memory always have uncompressed and files have compressed data. For wider range of sources and destinations, please see [compression streams](#ch_compress.streams).


<a name="ch_compress.streams"></a>

Streams
-------

Standard C++ streams (***istream***, ***ostream***, ***iostream***) and many derived classes provide a rich variety of functionality for formatted and unformatted I/O and can be used with wide range of data sources: memory, string, files and etc. The Compression API provide a set of classes that are compatible with standard C++ streams and can be used for compression or decompression data on-the-fly. Compression/decompression can be done transparently on reading or writing from/to stream, depends on using classes. 

Easiest way to start with compression/decompression streams is using classes from [include/util/compress/stream_util.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/stream_util.hpp). This header declares 4 wrapper stream classes:

-	 [CCompressIStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCCompressIStream.html) - input compression stream (compress on reading);
-	 [CCompressOStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCCompressOStream.html) - output compression stream (compress on writing);
-	 [CDecompressIStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCDecompressIStream.html) - input decompression stream (decompress on reading);
-	 [CDecompressOStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCDecompressOStream.html) - output decompression stream (decompress on writing).

Select a class that is more appropriate for yours needs, specify a compression method, pass some flags to the API if necessary, and all is done. Each class accept a parameter, that is a stream that have source data or receive result data. For (I) compression streams it should be a stream derived from ***istream***, and ***ostream***-based for (O). That parameter's stream is used as an input or output for data, compressed or decompressed, depends on the used class. You don't need to change yours existing code much to add support for data compression. Mostly, you need to add a single line of code to create one of the mentioned streams on top of the already existing stream.

For example, for reading some data from a stream and decompress it on-the-fly using `ZIP` method, just change yours code from:

	CSomeIstreamDerivedClass is(...);
	is.read(buf, len);
	
to this:

	CSomeIstreamDerivedClass is_orig(...);  // add ios_base::binary to stream's open mode
	CCompressIStream is(is_orig, CCompressStream::eZip, flags);
	is.read(buf, len);

You can use any C++ stream methods to access compression streams and use read/write, or formatted input/output, same way as an original stream. The compression streams fully compatible and just add an additional methods to check for compression status and possibility to get an error code or message for the last compression/decompression operation.
		
**Notes**

1. Because compressed data is a binary data, original input/output stream, passed as parameter to compression streams, should be always opened in a binary mode. Please do not forget to add `ios_base::binary` flag to your stream.

1. All compression (***CCompres\*[IO]Stream***) class objects must be finalized after use.  Only after finalization all data you put into stream will be compressed for sure. By default finalization is done in the class destructor, however it is better to call it directly by using ***Finalize()*** method. This allow to check result and be sure that you read/write all necessary data. You cannot do any checks if it is called in the destructor, just an exception if something went wrong. In the case of ***CCompress\*IStream*** you can only read from the stream after finalization. Compression can produce some data, that cannot be fit into the internal stream buffers, so if you don't read it, that some data can be lost. For ***CCompress\*OStream*** all compressed data will be automatically written to underlying stream after finalization. You don`t need to do a finalization for any decompression streams, it is doing automatically, when stream find logical end of the compressed data.

1. The compression streams write nothing into the output if no input data has provided. This can be especially important for cases where the output data should have any header/footer (like .gz files, for example). So, for empty input, you will have an empty output, that may not be acceptable to external tools like gunzip and etc. If you want to produce correct compression format even for empty input data, please use `fAllowEmptyData` flag. This flag is `OFF` by default.

1. There is one special aspect of compression stream classes ***CCompression[IO]Stream***. You should avoid flushing a stream if not necessary to get a better compression ratio. Basically, the compression algorithms work on blocks of data. They wait until a block is full and then compresses it. As long as you only feed data to the stream without flushing it works as expected, data will be flushed automatically on internal buffer overflow. If you flush stream, you force a premature end of the data block, regardless of it size. This will cause a worse compression ratio. So, input compression streams usually have worse compression ratio than output compression streams, because stream needs to flush data from compressor very often. Increasing compressor buffer size can amend this situation to some extent.


	
If you need to tune up a compression/decompression algorithm for yours needs, or have more control what is going on there, you can use original compression streams from [include/util/compress/stream.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/stream.hpp). There are several classes similar to the wrapper classes described above:

-	[CCompressionIStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCCompressionIStream.html)
-	[CCompressionOStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCCompressionOStream.html)
-	[CCompressionIOStream](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCCompressionIOStream.html)

The main difference, besides names, is that each class accept a "stream processor" as parameter, an object of some class derived from ***CCompressionStreamProcessor*** that perform a real compression or decompression. Each used compression library have its own implementation of stream processor. On the current moment, the Compression API have next stream processors:

-	[CBZip2StreamCompressor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBZip2StreamCompressor.html)
-	[CBZip2StreamDecompressor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCBZip2StreamDecompressor.html)
-	[CLZOStreamCompressor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCLZOStreamCompressor.html)
-	[CLZOStreamDecompressor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCLZOStreamDecompressor.html)
-	[CZipStreamCompressor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCZipStreamCompressor.html)
-	[CZipStreamDecompressor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCZipStreamDecompressor.html)
-	[CTransparentStreamProcessor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCTransparentStreamProcessor.html)

All library based "stream processors" accepts parameters specific for used library. See compression libraries for details and parameters description.

***CTransparentStreamProcessor*** is a special kind of stream processor, that do not perform any compression or decompression, it just copies data between input and output buffers. It can be used as adapter to allow compression streams works as regular streams, that can be useful in some special cases without changing already existing source code. Its usage may be less effective than accessing source underlying stream directly, because you have an extra memory copy. But it can be usable if you need access data `as is`. Also, all decompression streams support `fAllowTransparentRead` flag, that check that data is not compressed and provide it `as is` in that case, but ***CTransparentStreamProcessor*** allow to skip any checks if you already know that data is not compressed.

Here is an example how to read some data from a stream and decompress it on-the-fly using `ZIP` method:

	CSomeIstreamDerivedClass is_orig(...);  // add ios_base::binary to stream's open mode
	CCompressionIStream is(is_orig,
                         new CZipStreamDecompressor(... parameters/flags ...),
                         CCompressionIStream::fOwnProcessor));
	is.read(buf, len);

	
<a name="ch_compress.manipulators"></a>

Stream manipulators
-------------------

C++ manipulators are functions specifically designed to be used in conjunction with the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on stream objects. Compression/decompression manipulators looks like a manipulators, but are not a real ***iostream*** manipulators and have a little bit different semantics. 

With real stream manipulators you can write something like:

    os << manipulator << value;
  
that will have the same effect as: 

    os << manipulator; os << value; 
	
But with compression/decompression manipulators you can use only first form. Actually, "manipulators" compress/decompress a single item specified next to it rather than all items until the end of the statement. The `<<` manipulators accept any input stream or string as parameter, compress/decompress all data and put result into an output stream. The `>>` manipulators do the same, but input stream is specified on the left side of statement and output stream (or string) on the right.

All manipulators are declared in [include/util/compress/stream_util.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/stream_util.hpp) and include:

-	MCompress_BZip2
-	MCompress_LZO
-	MCompress_Zip
-	MCompress_GZipFile
-	MDecompress_BZip2
-	MDecompress_LZO
-	MDecompress_Zip
-	MDecompress_GZipFile,
-	MDecompress_ConcatenatedGZipFile

Manipulators are very easy to use, they don't require long definitions or initialization. 

Examples (`ZIP` compression/decompression for different sources):

	// Compress text or other stream, and write result to 'os'
	os << MCompress_Zip << "Text";
	os << MCompress_Zip << str;
	os << MCompress_Zip << is;
  
	// Decompress data from 'is' and put result to string or output stream
	is >> MDecompress_Zip >> str;
	is >> MDecompress_Zip >> os;

But this simplicity have a price. All manipulators use default parameters and flags for used compression methods, have limited error reporting (see notes below) and data sources. Each manipulator is just a shorthand for a [compression stream](#ch_compress.streams). It creates a corresponding compression/decompression/input/output stream, accept passed parameter, perform a compression or decompression, put result data into an output and destroys yourself. And all that in a single short line of code.

**Notes**

1. Be aware to use decompression manipulators with input streams as parameters. Manipulators will try to decompress data until EOF or decompression error. If the input stream contains something behind compressed data, that some portion of this data can be read into the internal buffers and cannot be returned back into the input stream.

1. Compression/decompression manipulators accepts streams, `char*` and `string` parameters only. No any other type.

1. The diagnostic is very limited. On error, it can throw an exception of type ***CCompressionException*** only.

Archivers
-----------------------

The C++ Toolkit Compression API include two subsets to work with compression archives: `Compression archive API` and `Tar archive API`. Historically `Tar archive API` was added first, it implements [TAR file format](#ch_compress.methods.tar.file) support. `Compression archive API` was designed to be a wrapper for a wide range of possible file archive formats and originally intended to include tar format support also, but due to some format specifics that has not done yet. The interfaces of both mentioned subsets are very similar, indeed.

<a name="ch_compress.archiver.arc"></a>

Compression archive API
-----------------------

Compression archive API implemented in [CArchive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCArchive.html) class and two derived classes [CArchiveFile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCArchiveFile.html) and [CArchiveMemory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCArchiveMemory.html), that support file- and memory-based archives accordingly. These classes have methods to create archives, add or extract files, list existing files, and etc, that we usually do with an archive files.

On the current moment archive API have support for [ZIP file format](#ch_compress.methods.zip.file) only. This is possible due to [Miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) compression library. Toolkit have embedded copy for `miniz`, see [miniz.c](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/util/compress/api/miniz/miniz.c), that is a part of the compression API.
	
That small library is very useful but have some limitation, so be aware:
-	No support for encrypted archives;
-	No support for `zip64` format, so the number of files in the archive limited to 65535.


<a name="ch_compress.archiver.tar"></a>

Tar archive API
---------------

The original [tar format](#ch_compress.methods.tar.file) was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated. Historically, many systems have implemented tar, so it have many variations. Our implementation supports subsets of POSIX.1-1988 (ustar), POSIX 1003.1-2001 (posix), old GNU (POSIX 1003.1), and V7 formats (all partially but reasonably). New archives are created using POSIX (genuine ustar) format, using GNU extensions for long names/links only when unavoidable. It cannot, however, handle all the exotics like sparse and contiguous files (yet still can work around them gracefully, if needed), multivolume and incremental archives, etc. It can handle regular files, devices (character or block), FIFOs, directories, and limited links: can extract both hard- and symlinks, but can store symlinks only. Also, this implementation is only minimally PAX(Portable Archive eXchange)-aware for file extractions (but cannot use PAX extensions to store the files).

See [CTar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCTar.html) for all methods and flags description.

Tar format support combining multiple files into one `.tar` file, that is not compressed. To add support for `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2` archives, ***CTar*** can be combined with [compression streams](#ch_compress.streams), it have a stream-based constructor, that can help here. For example, for accessing `.tar.gz` archive something like this can be used:

    ifstream ifs("some.tar.gz", ios_base::in | ios_base::binary);
    if (ifs.fail()) {
        // error
	}
    CDecompressIStream ics(ifs, CDecompressIStream::eGZipFile, flags);
    if (ics.fail()) {
		// error
	}
	CTar tar(ics);
	... 

**Note**

Note that if stream constructor is used, then ***CTar*** can only perform one pass over the archive. This means that only one full action will succeed (and if the action was to update (e.g. append) the archive, it has to be explicitly followed by Close() if no more appends are expected). Before next read/update action, the stream position must be explicitly reset to the beginning of the archive, or it also may remain at the end of the archive for a series of successive append operations


<a name="ch_compress.FAQ"></a>

FAQ
----------------

**Q. What header files do I need to include?**

This depends what functionality do you need.
-	Most universal header is
[<util/compress/stream_util.hpp>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/stream_util.hpp), it allow to use all functionality of the Compression API, except [archivers](#ch_compress.archivers).
-	To use some specific algorithm, like `ZIP`, you can include it/`s header directly
[<util/compress/zlib.hpp>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/zlib.hpp). This allow to use memory and files operations. 
-	For standard stream support you need [<util/compress/stream.hpp>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/stream.hpp).
-	For archive file format support: [<util/compress/archive.hpp>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/archive.hpp) or [<util/compress/tar.hpp>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/tar.hpp).


**Q. What do I need to add to my Makefile?**

You need to add the following:

    LIB = xcompress $(CMPRS_LIB) xncbi
    LIBS = $(CMPRS_LIBS) $(ORIG_LIBS)
    CPPFLAGS = $(CMPRS_INCLUDE) $(ORIG_CPPFLAGS)

For specific library, you can use more detailed `LIB` and `LIBS`, and omit all not used libraries:
	
    LIB  =  xcompress $(BZ2_LIB) $(Z_LIB) $(LZO_LIB) xncbi
    LIBS =  $(BZ2_LIBS) $(Z_LIBS) $(LZO_LIBS) $(ORIG_LIBS)
	

**Q. Can we compress/decompress data more than 4GB?**

Yes, all used compression methods have full support for data > 4GB. The size of compressed or uncompressed data is limited to size of `size_t` type only. 

Note 1. [Compression files](#ch_compress.files) have ***Read()*** and ***Write()*** methods, both are limited to return values of `long` type, to allow to return a negative values on errors. Both methods returns the number of bytes actually read/written, so you need to repeat calling it until all data has read/ written.

Note 2. [Streams](#ch_compress.streams) also have ***read()*** and ***write()*** methods derived from standard I/O streams, both accepts parameter of `std::streamsize` type, thats usually differ from used in the Compression API `size_t`. So all compression streams have two additional non-standard methods, that can be helpful:

Input streams:

    size_t Read(void* buf, size_t len);
  
Output streams:

    size_t Write(const void* buf, size_t len);


**Q. What is `CCompressStream::eNone` compression method for streams and its difference from `CCompress::eLevel_NoCompression` compression level?**

`CCompress::eLevel_NoCompression` is a library-defined compression level. Each library store data not compressed, but wrap it into its own footer and header, add checksums or other information depends on used compression format. `CCompressStream::eNone` is a specific compression method for our [compression streams](#ch_compress.streams). It uses [CTransparentStreamProcessor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCTransparentStreamProcessor.html), that do not perform any compression or decompression, do not add any header or footer, it just copy data "as is", and ignores specified compression level at all. See [streams](#ch_compress.streams) section for details.


**Q. How to read `.gz` file (decompress gzip data in-memory), the Compression API produces error code -3 on decompression?**

The Compression API supports [ZIP](#ch_compress.methods.zip) and [GZIP](#ch_compress.methods.gzip) compression methods. All in-memory compression and basic streams use `ZIP` by default. To change this behavior you need to specify appropriate flag(s), see `[CZipCompression](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCZipCompression.html)::EFlags` enum for details. Usually, `CZipCompression::fGZip` flag is what you needed.

[CZipCompressionFile](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCZipCompressionFile.html) uses `gzip` format by default, so no additional steps are required.

Utility streams in [include/util/compress/stream_util.hpp](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/include/util/compress/stream_util.hpp) supports 2 `ZLIB` based methods: `CCompressStream::eZip` for DEFLATE and gzip-compatible `CCompressStream::eGZipFile`, use second one to add .gz support.


**Q. It is unknown is data compressed or not, but I need to read it anyway. How to do this?**

You can try to decompress it, and if an error occurs, that probably yours data is not compressed, and you can use it "as is". Also, all compression methods have `fAllowTransparentRead` flag, that can do the same for you automatically and allow transparent reading data from buffer/file/stream regardless if have compressed data or not. You need to know possible used compression method anyway. Be aware, that if the source have broken compressed data, API cannot detect that it is compressed, and you get a binary junk instead of decompressed data. Also, you can try to check first bytes of data to much a `magic signature` for a specific format and [CFormatGuess](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/doxyhtml/classCFormatGuess.html) could be very useful for that:

	#include <util/format_guess.hpp>
	...
	CFormatGuess::EFormat format = CFormatGuess::Format(...input stream or file name...);
	switch (format) {
		case CFormatGuess::eGZip:  method = CCompressStream::eGZipFile;  break;
		case CFormatGuess::eBZip2: method = CCompressStream::eBZip2;     break;
		case CFormatGuess::eLzo:   method = CCompressStream::eLZO;       break;
		case CFormatGuess::eZip:   /* zip file format */                 break;
		default:                   method = CCompressStream::eNone;      break;
	}

To test on specific format you can use:

    CFormatGuess guess(...input stream or file name...);
    bool is_gzip = guess.TestFormat(CFormatGuess::eGZip);
